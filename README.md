This project is dedicated to developing a Recommender System using Elastic Search and a RAG based assistant in python. Our objective is to harness the extensive product data from Amazon.com to create accurate and user-centric product recommendations. Additionally, we have integrated a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Assistant, which combines the analytical strength of a large language model with data retrieval capabilities. This hybrid system is designed to enhance user experience in e-commerce settings by providing contextually relevant assistance and recommendations.
