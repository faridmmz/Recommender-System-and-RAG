And that\\'s it. That\\'s the extent of my cons list.\\n\\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I\\'ve been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \"fast\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it\\'s more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\\n\\nI\\'ve also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It\\'s uncanny.\\n\\nI\\'ve got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\'s everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There\\'s not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\\n\\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.', '4': 'The devices work so good, is light and fast !', '5': 'I could be wrong but I think the picture looks better than the old one. It’s a good buy if you don’t have one. The smaller one is OK. I had the older version and it’s noticeably smaller but not worth it if you own one. AS FOR COD MW3: Pay attention to your essential schedule. I’ve lost hours to his game because its just so good. It looks good and takes advantage of HDR. So many different available things to do but for sure activision is trying to figure out how to get their money out of you. A good bundle.', '6': \"Everything good.

Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging. Wife is super happy that she has the ps5 now but I'm worried we're going to be spending a lot of money on games now. But, you know what they say, happy wife... (and that's it)\", '12': 'The PS5 box was fresh, still had the little tape seal at the top, the Call of duty MW3 Voucher was in there and does work. The only thing I didn’t like was the Amazon box they put the PS5 box in didn’t have a lot of cushion to protect it, but I mean the PS5 box already protects the PS5 pretty well.\\n\\nI also would recommend putting very specific instructions on how to find your address as they accidentally delivered it to my neighbors even if you live in a house and not an apartment just something to better identify your home.', '13': 'The whole bundle came as advertised a brand new slim 2023 ps5 model with the removable disc drive, none of the marketing or descriptions disclosed that so i wasnt sure if this was the first model of ps5 or the new slim model that you can attach a disc derive to and it is indeed the new model with a modular drive. Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \"comlaint\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i\\'ve noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you\\'ve been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who\\'s wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles.'}, 'Related Products': [{'Product Name': 'Cooling Station for PS5 Stand with Controller Charging Station for Playstation 5 Console Disc/Digital, Cooling Stand for PS5 Cooler Fan Accessories for PS5 with 3 USB Hubs (Not for PS5 Slim Versions)', 'Product Price': '43', 'Product Rating': '4.2', 'Product Number of Rates': '36 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/81EPNlVqa6L._AC_SY355_.jpg', 'Product Description': \"Brand RJAD Form Factor Tower Compatible Devices Digital Edition, Disc Version Mounting Type Tabletop Special Feature 13 game slots, Dual controller charger, Headset Holder, Upgraded cooling fan, For Digital & Disc  COOLER STAND FOR PS5 WITH 3 USB HUBS & 3 LEVELS FAN SPEEDS: The cooler station for ps5 with cooling fan features an upgraded coolling fan with 3 levels adjustable speeds (high, mid, low) to cool down your console for ps5 by dissipating the heated air from the bottom of console for ps5, helping it stay away from overheating and extend service life of your console.

The ps5 fit perfect in the slots and so controllers have a spot too and best part it charges . It took like 2 hours to fully charge . It is not noisy at all. The stand is very good and strong . Everything looks way neater than before . I haven’t found any cons with it .', '4': 'This was a convenient and organized space for myPS5 and controllers while ensuring charging capabilities… But I dont recommend plugging it into the playstation… I say use your own power supply. The cooling function is particularly essential, aiding in the prevention of overheating issues often associated with the PS5 by sucking it out form the bottom as oppose to blowing it into the device ( avoid blowing dust inside the playstation at all cost). It helps maintain proper airflow and reduces dust build-up, promoting better performance. This stand comes highly recommended due to its effective and compact design.\\nDespite the impressive appearance and efficient fan operation that functions silently, a few drawbacks were noted by users. Charging the controllers can be a bit problematic, allowing only one controller to charge effectively when the PS5 is off. Even when powered by an outlet, it limits charging to one controller (this must be due to trying to avoid heat build up and killing the device and or they used very cheap parts inside), displaying an error message on the second one. This restriction hampers efficient charging, as it only permits charging both controllers if the PS5 remains turned on.\\nThe cooling system design might be a cause for concern, as some users were uncertain about its effectiveness and found the single tiny fan to be insufficient, considering its size. The warning notices in the manual about potential overloading of USB ports raise questions regarding the compatibility of using additional ports for charging and cooling the console simultaneously. The constraints in the power source options, especially the limitation to power the base solely from the PlayStation, add to the uncertainty. The lack of clarity in the charging instructions further confuses the users, giving an impression of uncertainty and inadequate electronic protection.\\nWhile the cooling station offers a neat setup, uncertainties surrounding its design, functionality, and charging limitations might make users hesitant to fully embrace it.', '5': \"In 30+ years of gaming, I've always been a horizontal guy, always thinking that I wasn't a fan of having them vertical. Either due to look, or just not trusting it wouldn't fall over (or be knocked over by me or someone else), but that has changed.\\n\\nI am still going to keep some consoles horizontal, but this little baby made me decide to keep my PS5 vertical. It honestly actually even looks better sitting that way. The extra storage for games and controllers is a very nice feature that I think anyone will find value in. However, what we all want to have these types of things for is to keep our PS5s cool.\\n\\nI'm aminly an RPG gamer. That is to say, I tend to spend a lot of time in long gaming sessions, once just an hour shy of a full day (that was for a charity challenge on twitch but meaning still stands). My consoles have in the past doubled as a space heater let's just say. Not with this baby. It was cool to the touch after a 9 hour session on NG+ of FF16 (great game). It also was cool the entire time I was downloading my very large ps4/ps5 digital library, along with some psplus stuff, which took about a day and a half (and majority of a 5tb external).\\n\\nBottom line, get this. If it can convert me to going vertical, and make sure I don't knock over or burn out my ps5, then it is worth the money.\", '6': 'Tried everything imaginable and my ps5 does not fit into this product. Not willing to break a new gaming console to make it work.', '7': \"This cooling system works great, it helps keep the playstation 5 from over heating and charges the wireless controllers when they aren't in use.. Our playstation was in a fairly roomy shelving system, but we were concerned that it might overheat and cause issues with the interior components... since Playstations aren't cheap, this device will do a great job of cooling..\\n\\nNot only does it work great it looks really cool as well.. I know I'd recommend this set up anytime, especially if you care about keeping your system working for years to come.. These newer systems aren't really made with longevity in mind, and do tend to get really hot, having the ability to cool your system as you game is paramount in keeping it up and running..\", '8': 'I wanted to like this product so bad.

Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\", '2': \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\", '3': 'Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\\n\\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\\n\\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.', '4': \"The Meta Quest 2 is a groundbreaking virtual reality (VR) headset that takes your gaming and entertainment experiences to new heights.

I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\\n\\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\\n\\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\\n\\nBuy it, you won't regret it\", '6': \"I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\\n\\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\\n\\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\\n\\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\\n\\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\\n\\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\", '7': 'I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.

I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.', '9': \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\", '10': \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"}, 'Related Products': [{'Product Name': 'Aluminum Alloy VR Headset Fast Charging Station Dock Stand for Oculus Quest 2 Meta Quest 2, [Support Elite Strap with Battery] with 4 Rechargeable Batteries and USB C Charger', 'Product Price': '59', 'Product Rating': '5.0', 'Product Number of Rates': '5 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/714sRxG6tfL._AC_SX522_.jpg', 'Product Description': 'Brand Tihorse Compatible Phone Models Oculus Quest 2 charge.

', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn\\'t worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn\\'t feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\\n\\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it\\'s probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\\n\\nI originally didn\\'t care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn\\'t upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn\\'t upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it\\'s not at all heavy and it\\'s very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let\\'s me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It\\'s a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It\\'s so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn\\'t think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don\\'t think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It\\'s super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that\\'s a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn\\'t think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don\\'t need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don\\'t feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\\n\\nI just can\\'t get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don\\'t know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn\\'t appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don\\'t buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don\\'t think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It\\'s better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don\\'t need the best WIFI routers since my router isn\\'t that great.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don\\'t use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won\\'t work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It\\'s easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it\\'s not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\\n\\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it\\'s a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it\\'s because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It\\'s a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\\n\\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn\\'t really have any replay value. I\\'m playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don\\'t find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren\\'t so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op\\'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\\n\\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn\\'t a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven\\'t really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don\\'t care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don\\'t like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you\\'d have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can\\'t let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It\\'s not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven\\'t had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can\\'t appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don\\'t get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn\\'t a Porsche. Entitled much? I\\'m already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.', '2': \"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\\n\\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\\n\\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\\n\\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\\n\\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\\n\\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\\n\\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\\n\\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\\n\\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\\n\\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!\", '3': \"Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\\n\\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\\n\\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.\", '4': \"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\\n\\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\\n\\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\\n\\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\\n\\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\\n\\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\\n\\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\\n\\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\\n\\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.\", '5': 'I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don\\'t accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn\\'t randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\\n\\nIt\\'s still not perfect, and here\\'s the bad so far:\\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you\\'re really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn\\'t ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\\n- I\\'ve heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I\\'ve played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there\\'s still no dedicated app) with no issues.\\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it\\'s clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn\\'t normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it\\'s still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.', '6': \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\", '7': \"I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\\n\\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\\n\\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\\n\\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!\", '8': 'I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I\\'m never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I\\'ve had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I\\'m 55 lol and I\\'m an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can\\'t believe how far I\\'ve come playing it! I\\'ve played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I\\'m talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don\\'t play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I\\'ve played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I\\'ve gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it\\'s because it\\'s a more powerful headset. I still don\\'t see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it\\'s doesn\\'t heat up .. yet.. we\\'ll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don\\'t judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I\\'m still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn\\'t get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I\\'m also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven\\'t tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It\\'s more like trying to see under water. At least it\\'s in color now. I\\'m not a big fan of mixed reality. I\\'m in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don\\'t want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they\\'d disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I\\'m doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It\\'s a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it\\'s not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI\\'m praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat\\'s it so far. I\\'ll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It\\'s not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don\\'t listen to all of the negative Nellie\\'s out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It\\'s all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he\\'d been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn\\'t have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡', '9': 'So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We\\'ve come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you\\'re playing games or experiences, you won\\'t even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don\\'t think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I\\'ve never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I\\'m super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn\\'t put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There\\'s a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who\\'s been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you\\'ll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You\\'re still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that\\'s too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there\\'s already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you\\'re not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You\\'re still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there\\'s a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won\\'t even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It\\'s amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that\\'s still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I\\'ve seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don\\'t need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it\\'s, \"oh wow, I never thought I\\'d get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here\\'s where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It\\'s one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn\\'t bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It\\'s not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn\\'t protrude as much, due to its new design, but it\\'s no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it\\'s a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it\\'s even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I\\'m playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.', '10': \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n😿 Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\\n\\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n😐 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\"}}]}}, {'_index': 'total_index', '_id': 'ROeqc40B-Q_i0rt4QUx1', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Related Products.Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Xbox Series X 1TB SSD Console - Includes Wireless Controller - Up to 120 frames per second - 16GB RAM 1TB SSD - Experience True 4K Gaming Velocity Architecture', 'Product Price': None, 'Product Rating': '4.8', 'Product Number of Rates': '24,432 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/51ojzJk77qL._SX342_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' XBOX SERIES X: The fastest, most powerful Xbox ever.

Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\\n\\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\\n\\nSPECS:\\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\\n\\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\\n\\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\\n\\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.\", '2': 'Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles – muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila! I was transported into a world of immersive gaming splendor.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk power, folks! With a whopping 1TB SSD, it\\'s like having a storage vault for every gaming adventure imaginable. The 16GB RAM felt like having a brain that processes game data quicker than a cheetah chasing its prey. The console revved up like a finely tuned sports car, promising gaming speeds faster than my cat chasing a laser pointer.\\n\\nThe promise of true 4K gaming sent shivers down my spine. The graphics were so sharp, I could almost see the pixels having a party! And with up to 120 frames per second, it\\'s like watching a movie in fast-forward, only it\\'s your gameplay and not a rom-com.\\n\\nThe Wireless Controller is like an extension of your own hand – sleek, comfortable, and responsive. It\\'s like having a magic wand (minus the spells, but hey, your gaming skills might feel magical).\\n\\nThe Velocity Architecture? It\\'s like having a gaming time machine, reducing loading times to mere blips on the screen. I blinked, and suddenly, I was in the midst of epic battles without the agony of waiting.\\n\\nHowever, even this gaming behemoth has its kryptonite. The only downside? The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast. But fear not, for the hours of gaming joy it provides will make you forget about those dollar signs faster than a high-speed race in Forza Horizon.\\n\\nNow, maneuverability? Let\\'s be real – this console isn\\'t going anywhere. It\\'s like a monolith, firmly rooted in your gaming universe. But who needs maneuverability when you\\'re anchored in a realm of gaming nirvana?\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a titan among gaming consoles, a symphony of power, graphics, and sheer gaming delight. It\\'s a gaming paradise that turns button-mashing into a delightful symphony of pixels. So, grab this console, embrace your inner gaming legend, and embark on gaming adventures that\\'ll leave you shouting \"Achievement Unlocked!\" like a boss!', '3': 'I bought this for Christmas for my son and we love it. It’s very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn’t see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn’t play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from “friends.” Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!', '4': \"Xbox Series X! The graphics are amazing, and it runs games smoothly. The quick load times are a game-changer, and the Game Pass library is a fantastic value. The library of games if compared to previous generations has been slightly disappointing but are starting to pick up. Xbox exclusive titles are great along with backward compatibility (select Xbox, 360, One games) provides a wide range of gaming options. However, the console's large size might be a concern for some users as I did not have any room on my current tv stand. Overall, it's a top-tier gaming system for both casual and hardcore gamers.\", '5': \"I love this console. Between the full backwards compatibility, the semi compact size, and the amazing performance, it's a great bang for buck! Much more performance than a similarly priced PC. Everything is smooth. Really worth the upgrade from an Xbox one.\", '6': 'Been wanting to upgrade my Xbox since this was announced. Finally was able to. Already opened up a couple games and was NOT expecting for them to load SO fast and to look SO clear and beautiful! So happy with this purchase!', '7': \"Very simple to set up and transfer from an Xbox One and felt the difference between next-gen. It's very helpful in showing what your setup can and can't do. At $399.99, the Series X is worth it.\", '8': 'This here Xbox Series X console, is the best of the best!!!! High speed power, 120 FPS, gaming power to the max!!!! Such a great purchase, I will purchase again in the near future for accessories!! Thank you Amazon for your amazing support on this product. I couldn’t thank you enough for the support.', '9': 'Delivery was fast, 2 days. Box was well packaged, sealed Xbox x.\\nSet up was simple, even for me. You just use your phone to set it up. I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn’t working, so wasn’t sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email/password. At that point, the Xbox wouldn’t let me power off using the controller, so I manually turned it off, waited a couple minutes, started again, restarted the “new console” set up, new code that worked, and before I knew it, I was at the Home Screen.\\nNo noticeable cosmetic or technical issues. This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.\\nLove premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one. Controller provided takes double A’s, so will buy another one with a bit more quality without dealing with batteries.\\nI used the disc drive, it works which is great, my old Xbox one blue Ray drive stopped working a couple years ago.\\nI will give an update after more use and game play, but initially, very happy to have this. I’ve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!\\nUPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games. Format is familiar like Xbox One, so not a lot of changes on the Home Screen and such. No issues playing games, watching movies, etc. very much like having this. Fun for everyone! Graphic updates are nice, however, if your using an older TV you prob won’t see too much difference. Highly recommend if your still on the fence about purchasing.', '10': 'So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\\n\\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it\\'s in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\\n\\nI\\'m upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I\\'ve got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\\n\\nAnd here it is.\\n\\nVisually speaking, I\\'m not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren\\'t there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that\\'s good. It\\'s just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I\\'m playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\\n\\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn\\'t anything on the Xbox that can\\'t be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there\\'s no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\\n\\nWell... I SAY that but I also don\\'t regret doing so. I\\'m disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn\\'t even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you\\'re in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There\\'s a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it\\'s not a selling feature if you\\'re comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox\\'s back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you\\'ll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren\\'t brand new exclusives. I\\'ve got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I\\'m going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\\n\\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It\\'s a good deal.\\n\\nI\\'m happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I\\'m also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it\\'s worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I\\'m going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\\n\\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don\\'t really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\\n\\nBut if Sony\\'s exclusives don\\'t move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin\\'s Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there\\'s enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\\n\\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There\\'s a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it\\'s here now! I have not used it yet but I\\'m sure I\\'ll get around to it.\\n\\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you\\'re getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\\n\\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)'}, 'Related Products': [{'Product Name': 'Persona 3 Reload: Collector’s Edition - Xbox Series X', 'Product Price': '199', 'Product Rating': None, 'Product Number of Rates': None, 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/81IaQ8rR3VL.__AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Experience the pivotal game of the Persona series faithfully remade with cutting-edge graphics, modernized quality-of-life features, and signature stylish UI.

', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn\\'t worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn\\'t feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\\n\\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it\\'s probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\\n\\nI originally didn\\'t care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn\\'t upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn\\'t upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it\\'s not at all heavy and it\\'s very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let\\'s me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It\\'s a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It\\'s so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn\\'t think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don\\'t think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It\\'s super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that\\'s a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn\\'t think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don\\'t need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don\\'t feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\\n\\nI just can\\'t get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don\\'t know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn\\'t appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don\\'t buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don\\'t think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It\\'s better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don\\'t need the best WIFI routers since my router isn\\'t that great.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don\\'t use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won\\'t work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It\\'s easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it\\'s not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\\n\\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it\\'s a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it\\'s because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It\\'s a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\\n\\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn\\'t really have any replay value. I\\'m playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don\\'t find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren\\'t so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op\\'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\\n\\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn\\'t a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven\\'t really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don\\'t care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don\\'t like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you\\'d have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can\\'t let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It\\'s not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven\\'t had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can\\'t appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don\\'t get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn\\'t a Porsche. Entitled much? I\\'m already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.', '2': \"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\\n\\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\\n\\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\\n\\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\\n\\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\\n\\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\\n\\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\\n\\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\\n\\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\\n\\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!\", '3': \"Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\\n\\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\\n\\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.\", '4': \"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\\n\\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\\n\\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\\n\\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\\n\\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\\n\\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\\n\\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\\n\\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\\n\\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.\", '5': 'I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don\\'t accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn\\'t randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\\n\\nIt\\'s still not perfect, and here\\'s the bad so far:\\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you\\'re really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn\\'t ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\\n- I\\'ve heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I\\'ve played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there\\'s still no dedicated app) with no issues.\\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it\\'s clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn\\'t normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it\\'s still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.', '6': \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\", '7': \"I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\\n\\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\\n\\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\\n\\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!\", '8': 'I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I\\'m never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I\\'ve had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I\\'m 55 lol and I\\'m an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can\\'t believe how far I\\'ve come playing it! I\\'ve played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I\\'m talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don\\'t play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I\\'ve played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I\\'ve gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it\\'s because it\\'s a more powerful headset. I still don\\'t see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it\\'s doesn\\'t heat up .. yet.. we\\'ll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don\\'t judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I\\'m still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn\\'t get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I\\'m also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven\\'t tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It\\'s more like trying to see under water. At least it\\'s in color now. I\\'m not a big fan of mixed reality. I\\'m in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don\\'t want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they\\'d disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I\\'m doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It\\'s a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it\\'s not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI\\'m praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat\\'s it so far. I\\'ll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It\\'s not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don\\'t listen to all of the negative Nellie\\'s out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It\\'s all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he\\'d been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn\\'t have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡', '9': 'So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We\\'ve come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you\\'re playing games or experiences, you won\\'t even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don\\'t think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I\\'ve never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I\\'m super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn\\'t put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There\\'s a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who\\'s been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you\\'ll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You\\'re still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that\\'s too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there\\'s already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you\\'re not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You\\'re still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there\\'s a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won\\'t even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It\\'s amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that\\'s still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I\\'ve seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don\\'t need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it\\'s, \"oh wow, I never thought I\\'d get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here\\'s where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It\\'s one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn\\'t bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It\\'s not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn\\'t protrude as much, due to its new design, but it\\'s no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it\\'s a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it\\'s even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I\\'m playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.', '10': \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n😿 Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\\n\\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n😐 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\"}, 'Related Products': [{'Product Name': 'Meta Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 128 GB', 'Product Price': '249', 'Product Rating': '4.7', 'Product Number of Rates': '67,700 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/61tE7IcuLmL._AC_SY355_.jpg', 'Product Description': 'Brand Meta Quest Color White Connectivity Technology Wi-Fi Included Components Quick Start Guide, Power Adapter (US, UK, EU, AU), Glass Spacer, 2 AA Batteries, Safety & Warranty Guide, Charging cabl… See more Compatible Devices Smartphone Model Name 899-00187-02 Product Dimensions 10.24\"D x 7.36\"W x 4.96\"H Operating System Oculus Field Of View 360 Connector Type USB Type C  Experience total immersion with 3D positional audio, hand tracking and easy-to-use controllers working together to make virtual worlds feel real.

Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\", '2': \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\", '3': 'Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\\n\\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\\n\\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.', '4': \"The Meta Quest 2 is a groundbreaking virtual reality (VR) headset that takes your gaming and entertainment experiences to new heights.

I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\\n\\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\\n\\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\\n\\nBuy it, you won't regret it\", '6': \"I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\\n\\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\\n\\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\\n\\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\\n\\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\\n\\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\", '7': 'I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.

I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.', '9': \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\", '10': \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"}}, {'Product Name': 'Hurra Battery Head Strap Compatible with Meta Quest 3, 10000mAh Fast Charging Battery Pack Headstrap Extend Playtime, Adjustable Elite Strap Replacement Accessories Compatible with Oculus Quest 3', 'Product Price': '59', 'Product Rating': None, 'Product Number of Rates': None, 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/61vnF9EQAjL._AC_SY355_.jpg', 'Product Description': \"Brand Hurra Color White Special Feature Quick Charge, 10000mAh Large Capacity, 52° Adjustable Design Connectivity Technology USB Included Components 1 x Type-C Power Cord, 1 x User Manual, 1 x Head Strap with 10000mAh Battery Pack Compatible with Meta/Oculus Que… See more Compatible Devices Meta Quest 3 Specific Uses For Product Video, Gaming Model Name Head Strap with 10000mAh Battery Pack Compatible with Meta/Oculus Quest 3 Number of Batteries 1  Safe Built-in 10000mAh Battery: This head strap built-in 10000mAh high-capacity battery, which can extend extra 4-7h playtime for VR headset.

I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case. The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you. The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.\\n\\nInside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges. Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.\\n\\nPlease see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards\\n* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!\\n* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.\\n* Handle for carrying the case.\\n* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.\\n* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.\\n\\nThis case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40!

However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.\", '5': \"This carrier for the Nintendo Switch is really nice.

After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family\\'s favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey\\'s Cappy or Mario Sunshine\\'s FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don\\'t need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren\\'t quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you\\'d expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn\\'t notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \"Super Mario Wonder\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don\\'t receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I\\'ll update as we continue our adventure...', '2': \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\\n\\nGameplay and Mechanics:\\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical.

It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value.

My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10', '5': \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\", '6': \"The graphics are a visual treat. The vibrant colors and detailed landscapes make every level a work of art. It's like playing in a living, breathing cartoon world, and it's utterly captivating.\\n\\nThe gameplay is where the real magic happens. Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\\n\\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\\n\\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.\", '7': \"Overall it's a nice game. Bought this for my kid but I play with him sometimes. Graphics are nice and Mario super powers are cool and way more that it use to be. Worlds are very elaborated and it's cool that u can add another player on the spot\", '8': 'Title says it all. This is an excellent game. It\\'s peak platforming with a ton of charm and unique ideas.\\n\\nOne one complaint is how difficult multiplayer can be. It\\'s definitely functional but with some stranger choices regarding who is \"player 1,\" a too-zoomed-in camera following whoever is in the lead, and stages that are affected by individual player movements, this game feels optimized for single-player. Great for a solo play. Less good for play with family and friends.', '9': 'So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10', '10': \"This is so fun!!! Last year I got this deep, insane itch to play Super Mario Bros. on 3DS, which is what I grew up playing. However, after digging through my games, I couldn't find it. My local game store has the game marked up so high that I decided I would rather cry and keep my money. So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It.\"}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'total_index', '_id': 'SOeqc40B-Q_i0rt4Qkxr', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Nintendo Switch™ - OLED Model: Super Smash Bros.™ Ultimate Bundle (Full Game Download + 3 Mo.

It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.\\n\\nSO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES\\n\\n1. theres 3 versions\\n- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)\\n- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)\\n- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)\\n\\n2. Games\\n- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.\\n\\n-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.\\n\\n- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.\\n\\n3. How they work (docked versions)\\n- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.\\n- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.\\n- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.\\n\\nPersonally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time. Although they might not be the best graphically they have some fun family friendly first party games.\", '2': \"First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode. (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!) I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.\\n\\nWith that being said, this device is shockingly awesome. Why? You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands. This blows me away. The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold. As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most. It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go. I travel for work and personal reasons. This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well. They are awesome. However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc. Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming. So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).\\n\\nThen, the OLED screen is gorgeous. I had an original Switch. I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity. Some games look totally different. If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one. I absolutely love it. I even bought a 512GB micro SD card. I am in a form of gaming Nirvana. You will really enjoy this model.\\n\\nFinally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch. I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades. Why? Think about it. As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold. It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades. What is it they need? Just a little more power. If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade. Why? 1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance. With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch. So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.\\n\\nAt any rate, I digress. If you are considering this device. Get it! Period. The build is so awesome on this variant. You will love it.\\n\\nI have to go now. I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!\\n\\nAlso, the delivery from this seller was also good. It came ahead of time.\", '3': \"The Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con is an exceptional gaming device that delivers an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience. With its OLED display, the graphics are vibrant and sharp, bringing games to life with vivid colors and enhanced contrast.\\n\\nThe versatility of the Nintendo Switch allows you to seamlessly transition between playing on the big screen and taking your gaming on the go. The handheld mode provides the freedom to enjoy your favorite games anywhere, while the option to dock the console and play on a TV offers a more immersive gaming experience.\\n\\nThe Joy-Con controllers are comfortable to hold and offer precise controls, ensuring smooth gameplay and responsive inputs. The neon red and neon blue color scheme adds a vibrant and stylish touch to the console, making it visually appealing.\\n\\nThe console's library of games is extensive, offering a wide range of titles for all types of gamers. From popular franchises to indie gems, there is something for everyone. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch Online service provides access to a growing collection of classic NES and Super NES games, as well as online multiplayer functionality.\\n\\nOverall, the Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con is a fantastic gaming device that combines portability, versatility, and stunning visuals. Whether you're a casual gamer or a dedicated enthusiast, this console is sure to provide countless hours of enjoyment and entertainment.\", '4': 'I love my switch. The graphics run much smoother on OLED. It was totally worth the purchase! If you’re going to buy a switch, go all the way with the LED. I own all 3 versions, the original, two lites and the OLED and I love the OLED the most! Quick delivery, brand spanking new. If you’re going to get one be mindful of the country you buy it from, as it will impact you. Meaning, you don’t want a version not made for USA if you live here as the charging components will not work. Outside of that you’re good to go!', '5': \"I think the screen itself improves the playing experience so much compared to the first switch model. The screen is what you would expect of an OLED screen nice bright deep colors with true black. Battery lasts 2-3 hours but i've only tested that with Animal Crossing New Horizons. I enjoy watching youtube on here as well. Dock modes work perfectly fine as well!\", '6': 'This moderate upgrade of the Nintendo Switch is definitely worth spending an extra $50 to get if you are already in the market for a new Switch. The most important question though, is if it\\'s worth it for the people who already own a Switch. This depends a lot on personal preference as well as how old your current switch is (and if you own the original HAC001 from 2017-2019 or the V2 that released in late summer of 2019). I mostly play in handheld mode because that is what this console excels at, for playing on a TV/Monitor, there are plenty of better options.\\n\\nSo what do you get with this OLED model? You get a larger screen that is OLED instead of IPS LCD. This is the type of screen that most iPhones have used since 2017 (and all of them use it now except for the SE2). You get a better contrast ratio, meaning deeper blacks and brighter colors/whites. There is no HDR support like Dolby Vision or HDR10, but it still looks leagues better than all the other Switch models. The smaller borders around the screen make the device look more modern and it\\'s the size they should have gone with from the beginning (even if the logistics of using OLED wasn\\'t feasible in 2017). There is also improved speakers, they do sound better and make the games your playing sound larger and more immersive. It\\'s not as big of a difference as the new screen is to the old screen, but it\\'s still a good thing to include.\\n\\nAnother new features is a better kickstand that is more like that of a Surface Pro tablet, allowing the Switch to be able to lean all the way back and be much more sturdy while doing so. This isn\\'t really important unless you play in tabletop mode, but this is more realistic of a way to use this console with the screen being just that much bigger, I could see myself using a Pro controller and sitting the switch down for certain types of games.\\n\\nThe last difference here is the dock, which has a built in Ethernet port, which you should really use if you have the option to go wired. Unlike in the previous model \"regular Switch\", a wired connection is basically twice as fast as using standard WiFI, before it was only about 1.5x as fast. It still is unfortunate that you cannot achieve 100Mbps download speeds, but 60-65 is better than the 40-45 I was getting on my older model.\\n\\nIf I had to oversimplify who should buy the OLED model, I would say that these two types of people should buy the OLED (even if they already have a Switch Lite or V2) It would be: techie people who are nerdy about their tech and want the best they can get (even when they don\\'t need it), and serious gamers who sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into playing the Switch in handheld mode.\\n\\nAlso, I don’t know that we need to specify this anymore because the switch OLED has largely been in stock since early January. But I did not and would not pay one penny more than $350 (plus tax) for this console. I think it’s worth that price if you love Nintendo characters/games, but I don’t think the hardware is worth more than $400 and the tax gets it pretty close to that.', '7': \"If you would have told me 40 years ago I'd be playing games that look like this anywhere I wanted, I would have thought you were crazy (Let alone come home and finish playing it on my TV!) With an amazing library of games and accessories, I'm having an absolute blast playing my switch. Having an OLED screen is just the cherry on top of the Sunday!\", '8': 'This is the new OLED version of the Nintendo Switch. Decided to replace his old Switch that cracked from an accidental drop one day. Turned out to be the perfect B-day gift. He loves it! The screen is bigger and the colors are superior in every way to what his old Switch looked like. Amazing how much more vibrant the games look with this new version. All his little buddies want one now too!', '9': 'I\\'m old. I know nothing of these things. I started to \"google\" and \"research,\" (WTF happened to the trip to the library; pouring through the books and being b***ched out by the Gestapo librarian... these kids are missing so much...) and i found this one seemed to be what I wanted to \"gift\" my grandson & son. We all live together, vicariously and pseudo-parasidically, and some diversion is in order. SOOOO... g\\'ma is springing for some entertainment. Son Prince informs me what I want is *this* which is good cuz I already ordered it cuz I was running out of time and I dont like to shop, but \"google\" said this one was best for our age group. (4 year old, and two adults that act 4). It came, and I asked said Son set it up and make sure it worked and was what they wanted.

I need a drink.', '10': 'This is my first gaming console after a long time, before I played on old PS and Nintendo 2DS, but this OLED switch is day and night difference.

Choosing a gaming console appropriate to audiences I got (my kids of course), was no brainer 1/Since this console can be played handheld so travel friendly with kids 2/Can be easily switched to TV for big screen experience 3/Multiplayer games are fun because you have two joycons 4/Light weight on the hands 5/Joycons are most suitable for your kids, however, both Joycons can be clubbed to use as full controller on Joycon Grip 6/Docking is breeze 7/Longer play time on switch screen 8/Kids can use switch as Table Top mode (use the inbuilt screen and put it on table and play when on travel, fun to have both kids sit side by side in a car 9/The Dock is light weight and HDMI, LAN and power adapter can be connected 10/You can charge with USB-C while on travel..

No discount I saw so far on Mario games 4/I need to check the switch specs, but I am sure there is no 4K support even I connected to my Sony Bravia x90K 85\" 4K/120 Hz HDMi 2.1 input, used HDMi 4 input which is 4K/120 Hz compatible. 5/Sound on switch is alright, well, good that your kids won\\'t annoy you while they play on switch and not on TV 6/Internal memory is adequate, only 64GB, initially okay but can\\'t put more games if you gonna install more than 15 (3 gb per game), should be alright if kids want to experiment free games and just recycle them.\\n\\nNothing major negative though, all good so far! Hopefully you will enjoy your brand new console! So far I love it since my 5 years Son can easily handle without much adult supervision!!!

It gives personalities to icons like Peach and Bowser.\\n\\nThis is the game that introduced various features of these characters that we would go on to see in later games, especially stuff like Peach being equipped with umbrellas and frying pans, or treating fireballs as sort of a default power that Mario has up his sleeve, even without picking up a Fire Flower (as we see in Super Smash Bros).\\n\\nThis game also introduces a number of unique new characters who are absolutely fantastic, and deserve to be in dozens of more games.\\nGeno, Mallow, Croco, Booster, Johnny, etc.\\n\\nIn a year when The Legend Of Zelda:Tears Of The Kingdom came out, Super Mario RPG's remake ended up being my Game Of The Year.\\nAs great as TOTK is, and as much crazy big ambitious stuff and complexity as it rings to the table, it falls faaaaar short of achieving its true potential, and there are huge swaths of that game that feel lacking and incomplete.\\nSuper Mario RPG does not have that problem for even a second.\\nEverything in Super Mario RPG feels like it is living VERY close to the maximum potential of the Mario franchise.\\nEvery second is fun. Everything is interesting. The whole world is full of stuff to find and do, and people to talk to, and silly jokes and gags, and interesting little story bits.\\nHow many dungeons and boss fights are there in Zelda TOTK? Maybe 10 if you count one instance of each species of big regular monster (Ganon, Temple bosses, Hinox, Gleeok, Talus, Flux Construct, etc?)\\nI have literally no idea how many boss fights Super Mario RPG has.\\nThere are so so many.\\nSuper Mario RPG has like 4-5 boss battles JUST within the tutorial area. I can think of at least 30 bosses in Super Mario RPG, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch.\\n\\nIt's not a perfect game, but for a game that came out 30 years ago, and has only been minimally upgraded in this remake, it is SHOCKINGLY close.\\n\\nOf all the Mario games that exist, this one is One of the must-have games in the series, alongside: Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with all the DLC, Super Mario Bros Wonder,.....and the remake of Super Mario 64 that they absolutely desperately need to make.....\\n\\nThis is better than the original Mario Bros, the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros The Lost levels, Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, all the Paper Mario games, all the Super Mario Land games, all the Mario Party games, almost all of the Mario Kart games, all the Mario sports games, etc etc etc.\\n\\nThis belongs in that core handful of Mario games that every gamer needs to play to understand how phenomenal Mario can truly be.\\n\\nIt's a tiny thumbnail-sized game cartridge full of happiness.\\n\\n🤷🏻\\u200d♂️\", '2': 'Such an amazing game-It’s incredible as a first time play, and sweetly nostalgic as a remake for those (like me) who played the original. The gameplay is smooth as ever, the visuals are stunning and heartwarming, and the development of the characters is incredibly endearing (both with their storylines and how they grow in battle).\\nThe original has personally always been my favorite game of all time, and this version on the switch is even better.', '3': \"The game holds very true to the original. Improved graphics, quality of life improvements to inventory, combat and overall management.\\nSome of the bosses and characters have new names (not sure what those are about, one could be cultural sensitivity, which is fine), but it doesn't detract from the overall game.\\nVery happy to play this and it goes much faster than I remember (I'm on story mode, so that could be part of it, also very happy that's an option for the more casual gamer!).\", '4': \"There will, no doubt, be those who disagree with this sentiment, but as someone who dearly loves the original game, and has played through it several times over the course of my life, THIS is what every remake of any game should aspire to. It keeps faithful to the original game, while improving on it in many ways. Some fights feel easier, while others feel harder. Parts of the game I would have sworn were longer are now shorter. There are cutscenes that add more to basically all of the characters, the updated graphics keep all the charm of the game's style while looking great, and the ending cinematic made me smile like a little kid. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time, brought by a brilliant remake of an already excellent game. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. Seven would seem an appropriate number.\", '5': 'If you are expecting a typical side scroll 2D jump, jump, jump Mario game, you will be disappointed (watch the trailers).\\n\\nBasic Plot: Mario and his team must join together and save all the people in the mushroom kingdom from the evil Smithy, a monster who destroyed the star road so that people’s wishes will never come true (simplified version).\\n\\nGeneral review: The game stays true to the original SNES title with minor changes and quality of life improvements. The game looks fantastic and plays true to the original. The plot and story are much more complex compared to typical Mario saves Peach games. The characters are extremely unique and bring a whole lot of personality to the Mario world and characters we love. It is not an open world game, but there are still quite a few areas to explore with secrets and treasures to find.\\n\\nGameplay: The fight sequences use a turn based style where the three people in your party take turns to attack before your enemy (s) will have their turn to counter attack (simple explanation of it). The turn based style can be repetitive and boring if you are not accustomed to this gameplay or looking for something more fast paced.\\n\\nGameplay: This is an RPG so you do gain experience points as you slay enemies and level up your party members. When you level, you will have 3 options to pick from: physical attack/defense, magical attack/defense, or health/hp. Whichever you pick, the stats within that category will increase. For an RPG, it is a very simple leveling system and easy to understand without getting overly complex.\\n\\nMy experience: Personally, I played/beat the original SNES countless times and was able to beat this remastered version to 100% within 12 hours… but again, experience was on my side. I would say for someone new to this, it could take them 10 - 20 hours - a shorter and easier RPG with a captivating plot.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: It is an easy RPG for experienced players but you play for the story (or nostalgia), not the difficulty. If you are looking for a good, easy introduction to RPGs, this is a good game to start with for not being overly complicated. If you do not like turn based attacks, RPGs, or just looking for a typical fast paced challenging Mario game, this is not the game for you.\\n\\n5 stars for a 1-1 remaster of the original (with additional, new gameplay content) and what I expected the game would be.', '6': \"This was my first RPG I remember playing back in 1996. It launched my love of turn based role playing games. I think I beat this game a few dozen times on the Super Nintendo when I was 12. I have very fond memories of this game. So when I heard it was being released on the switch I was very excited.\\n\\nI broke one of my cardinal rules of game buying with this. I pre-ordered it. Nintendo rarely has launch issues with games but I still try to avoid pre-ordering games. But I couldn't help myself with this one.\\n\\nThe game is excellent. They upgraded the graphics which may have taken away some of the charm of the original but I think it looks great. They even kept in the 2d OG mario Easter Egg in Boosters Tower, and pixelated Culex boss. The game play was exactly as I remembered it and still a joy to play.\\n\\nNintendo made a few quality of life improvements to the game. First they created a Breezy mode which makes the game just a bit easier. It lifts the item cap, makes the timed attack window larger and more forgiving, and makes the enemies easier (I have my 6 year old playing on this setting).\\n\\nOther QOL improvements include adding an icon to help with timed attacks. A chest in Mario's house to carry extra items where in the original they would just be lost. The game now auto saves pretty frequently (usually as you enter a new area), so you don't have to search out a save location. They also added a upgrade to the signal ring that makes it easier to find hidden treasures, that can be acquired later in the game. They also added post game play, making the bosses more challenging and adding new weapons and gear.\\n\\nMost of the online reviews to this game forget it's an introductory RPG meant for children. They nitpick and complain about the lack of challenge. Super Mario RPG is a fantastic game that will take around 13 hours to beat, but it's a great 13 hours. If you played this game in the 90s get it. If you have a child and are looking to get them a forgiving turn based RPG to learn, get this game. If you are looking for 13 hours of fun without the grind of games like Final Fantasy, get this game. If you want a challenging grueling slog that will take hours off your life and leave you angry most of the time, get Dark Souls.\", '7': \"The developers of this game knew exactly what it would take to please the fans of this game. Simply put, this game is the best remake that I have played in the past couple of years. It has so much love poured into it, every detail that I expected to be here from the original game is here- and additional content. I was incredibly scared that the hype for this game was going to end up causing it to be a bad game, but that is not the case.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic game that caters to both fans of the original game and those who are wanting to get into RPGs. I have seen several 1 star reviews, and to be completely honest those reviews seemed to have come from those who have never played an RPG before and expected simply another Mario game coming into this. I can't think of anything that this game doesn't improve upon from the original game. The RPG mechanics are engaging, even difficult at times with having the player time certain actions within battles to drastically change the gameplay. However, it does a fantastic job with the ! indicators telling the player when to properly time their button presses.\\n\\nThe story is of course a remake of the original title on the SNES, however I believe that its humor still stands today. I can't really say many games today make me laugh the way they intended or at least without a slight awkward feeling at a forced joke, but this game actually makes me smile more often than not. This game has some seriously funny moments, and the modernized visuals make scenes much more entertaining.\\n\\nThe only negative element I can even come up with for this game is the slight frame drops when the scene gets too intense with effects and too many models. Aside from that, the game runs at seemingly a solid 60 fps, with 30 fps for the cutscenes. Aside from the random moments of lag, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic.\\n\\nI without a doubt recommend this game.\", '8': \"Short RPG games are rare, so if you want something you can complete in 10 hours or so, then Super Mario RPG can be great for you. The gameplay is fun and the writing is still as charming as the original title that came out nearly three decades ago. It's definitely worth its price.\\n\\nThe post game has been expanded upon, too.\", '9': \"The problem with remaking video games is the design philosophy around what a remake should even try to accomplish. Video games just don't age as well as products from most other mediums. True, I love video games and they are my favorite way to pass time, but game mechanics, graphics and interactivity can resonate with older audiences that hadn't encountered them before while newer ones will often at best find them quaint and others find them cumbersome. Should a remake essentially tart up the aesthetics and keep the core gameplay the same, winning over the original audience but potentially losing the new? Or should a remake shake things up, evolving what was rusty from the ground up, risking the loss of what made the game special to begin with?\\n\\nSuper Mario RPG is unabashedly in the first camp. It is very safe. It introduces some minor mechanics like the triple attacks that don't factor much in moment to moment gameplay at all, and adds some boss rematches and such. It sticks close to the original, remaking the graphics and music but not really shaking up the script, the general story, the turn based gameplay or the bad platforming (for a Mario game, even an RPG, that's honestly a serious flaw for a game with a lot of it).\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who has always had a fascination with Super Mario RPG, but never played through it entirely, this remake gave me my fill. I still prefer its successors; the first two Paper Marios are simply tighter, more engaging experiences. Regardless, this game is funny, quite charming, and has lots of cute metagame moments, like a boss that literally disables your attack options (novel for 1996). I do think it loses a bit in the jump to 3D; the original 2D, chunky graphics were beautiful and strange and compelling and gave rise to many memes because of it. The remake looks good but in a bland way, not blocky and puffy like the old sprites but losing a bit of their memorability. The music is of course fantastic. Yoko rarely misses.\\n\\nIt's a strangely unbalanced experience, in terms of pacing. Some stars are found much quicker than others, and a decent amount of the story feels like padding, albeit amusing padding. The final area(s) feel rushed and the finicky imprecise jumping controls I feel really falter here.\\n\\nIf it sounds like my review is a little harsher than kind, it's because I hadn't grown up with this game and I'm approaching it as an N64 kid playing it for the first time being almost in my thirties. People who played and loved the original will have plenty of fun seeing what was changed, reliving iconic moments and so on. In all honesty it's a good game, and still worth playing. All Mario RPGs, and even many RPGs in general now, borrow a lot from this game and that has to be acknowledged. It's influential for a reason; the people at Square clearly loved making this game, and that rubs off on the player. I just wish that reverence could factor into bolder gestures toward making the game fresher over 25 years later, and by not charging full price for what is nearly the same amount of game content from '96.\\n\\nRecommended if you like Mario, easy SNES RPGs, and big Yoshis, and especially if you like all three.\", '10': 'This is nearly a 1 to 1 remake of the original Super Mario RPG game. The music remaster is beautiful and you can even opt for the original soundtrack in the settings. But the remaster of the music is so good you may not want to. All the little things you may remember (if you played the original) are still there. The hidden block you only have one or two opportunities to grab in the Mushroom Kingdom... Link and Samus snoozing at the inn.\\n\\nWhat they did is they recreated the entire game with updated HD graphics. But kept Mario\\'s pudgy little design the same. The \"cutscenes\" have been replaced with full rendered cutscenes that pan down to in game engine graphics instead of just watching in game graphics move about to act out a scene.\\n\\nThe best change though is the post game content. Rematches with all the bosses (story element explains why) and they are much tougher the second time around. New \"ultimate\" weapons post game and even some new super bosses to use those shiny new weapons on.\\n\\nThey pretty much kept the original experience until you beat the game. After that, they gave you more to chew on as additions. A bestiary. A music player. In game stats. Super bosses, rematches, new gear.\\n\\nThis is how you do a remaster. A proper remaster.\\n\\nI truly hope they use all this effort to give this game a long overdue sequel. Because it is one of the best Mario games out there.

Its mechanics offer immense freedom in both puzzles and combat, enriching the exploration aspect.\\n\\nRefreshing Changes\\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things feeling fresh.

They've done an excellent job with Zelda's character, and it's enjoyable to connect the dots between the new events in Tears of the Kingdom and what transpired between it and Breath of the Wild.\\n\\nCONS:\\nPerformance Issues\\n-One downside is occasional lag, even on an OLED. If you have an older Switch, you may experience even worse frame drops, which can be quite frustrating.\\n\\nDisconnect from BOTW\\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven't experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they've never met you before. It's not a deal-breaker but feels like an odd design choice.\", '4': 'Negatives first:\\nThere are a decent amount of reused themes and mechanics that I do wish they could have changed up a bit. There is definitely some repetitiveness there.\\nThe graphics (and I am not a graphics-first person...ever) are a problem here and there...I think it\\'s a theming choice made by nintendo more than anything, but in the sky islands they add this cloudiness effect to everything (even in sky island caves) that can make it difficult to discern things. It\\'s hard to explain, but I actually had to change my display settings to crank up the contrast (which is screwing up my settings on my other games and consoles). My kids even mentioned how hard it is to see things at times.\\n\\nPositives\\nPeople are complaining about similarity to BotW....and I don\\'t get it. As big as the BotW world was, it feels small compared to this game. I\\'m about 10 hours in, I haven\\'t done anything yet that felt like a retread (other than what I mentioned above). It has the same \"see something out of the corner of your eye, go investigate, and lose two hours\" trait that I loved about BotW.\\nThis game is much more story driven (not through flashbacks) thus far, which is great.\\n\\nSo-so\\nThe new weapons mechanics are cool...but I do miss more traditional weapons at times. So far (and this may change as I get deeper) everything I\\'ve found is stupid under powered, you always have to craft to have anything useful. The crafting/building is fun and new, but how you HAVE TO do so much of it that it can be game-breaking here and there.\\n\\nI love the game, I can\\'t wait until I have some real time to sink a few uninterrupted days into it. It is not perfect, but I still gave it a perfect score because the fun-factor and awe of BotW are absolutely in-tact and the scale is unbelievable. The positives erase the negatives in my mind.', '5': 'Stepping into a new chapter in the iconic Legend of Zelda series, \"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" is a masterclass in video game design. Drawing upon the rich history of this beloved franchise, this game artfully interweaves nostalgic elements with a fresh, innovative perspective, making it a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I truly though it would just be a chewed-up and spit-out breath of the wild, its not, its better!\\n\\nWhat immediately captivates the player is the deeply immersive world, teeming with intricate details and the unparalleled charm we\\'ve come to expect from the Zelda franchise. Every kingdom, every landscape feels alive and filled with potential adventure, inviting players to lose themselves in the exploration.\\n\\nThe game mechanics remain faithful to the Zelda essence, while introducing new, cleverly designed features that elevate the overall gaming experience. It has the same shrine system as botw but new ways to work through puzzles and rewards you for being inventive.\\n\\nThe narrative of \"Tears of the Kingdom\" is enchanting and engaging, drawing you into its depths with each progressing plot point. The character development, including the evolving relationship between Link and Zelda, is genuinely touching and contributes greatly to the emotional resonance of the story.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s worth mentioning that \"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" is a game that demands time and patience. The expansive world and multiple sub-quests can be overwhelming to some, but for those willing to invest the effort, the rewards are plentiful.\\n\\nThe only slight drawback is the game\\'s item-breaking mechanic. weapons you love will break and you will miss them. That being said just keep with it and soon you will find something even better.', '6': \"This is Link at his finest. He has really grown into the super hero role he was meant to have.\\n\\nThe story is a bit lackluster, as usual. There are lots of quests and so much content that you can spend hundreds of hours playing this, but the stories are always a little cringy and lame. It is meant to be kid-safe, after all.\\n\\nThe game mechanics are where this game shines. Zonai devices allow you to build practically any kind of vehicle you want. Like Minecraft, except that things are meant to move, with circles and everything. The physics is extremely robust. Link can engineer up doomsday devices and ride them into enemy camps.\\n\\nThe game design is beautiful, just like its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. It's the same Hyrule surface map, but there are over a hundred new cave systems, a sky island map, and a Depths map, which is sort of an Upside Down under Hyrule. I like that the devs kept the best parts of BotW and merely expanded it into a whole new kind of game.\\n\\nCombat in BotW/TotK is great, and lots of fun. Back when I was playing Zelda for NES and SNES, I never would have imagined that the game franchise would get to this level of amazing.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is the story. There is basically no consistency between Zelda games, each one has to be taken as its own independent narrative. I know there are people who try to mesh it all together -- even Nintendo came out with a timeline once -- but I don't buy it. If their next game could be both consistent within itself, and utilize the best aspects of all past Zelda stories, Nintendo could set up future games after that for sequential story telling, and that would be fantastic. It's the only thing the game is missing.\\n\\nThis is basically a single player RPG meets Open World Sandbox. The best kind of RPG. You can follow quest lines, and there are many -- you can collect things, there are tons of things to collect -- or you can just build devices and defeat enemies for fun. You don't even have to pursue the main story line and you can still love this game. Highly recommend!!\", '7': 'Where to begin with this game? Did you enjoy Breath of the Wild? Were you frustrated by certain aspects? If the answer was yes to both, you’ll love this game.\\n\\nI have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\\n\\nNow we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\\n\\nThe new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it’s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\\n\\nFinally there’s the story. I was surprised after feeling BOTW had a very forgettable story that this had a very rich and emotional story as you learn about how Ganondorf came to power and was originally defeated, as well and the truth of what happened to Zelda after the start of the game. I absolutely love it and all the characters. Honestly, the only two Zelda games to top this for me are Wind Waker and Link’s Awakening.\\n\\nSo yes, to sum up, this is easily one of the best Zelda games of all time and improves on BOTW so much, I can’t even see myself revisiting that game now.', '8': 'Perfect sequel to Zelda Breath of The Wild. Link has several new abilities (will list later) to play around with\\n\\nWorld is more expansive: There’s the Great Plateau (old Breath of the Wild map) with slightly altered environments due to gloom infection, the sky city, and the depths (huge underground cave network below hyrule). Smoke and highlighted light pillars shows points of interest in the overworld without having to look at the map\\n\\nWeapon durability is back. I know some people don’t like breakable items/weapons, but it teaches kids to be more adaptable rather than have constant/sustainable gains all the time. Also helps them be more creative in the fusing items together. Items are less scarce this time around giving you more opportunities to experiment with new combinations\\n\\nStill have freedom to be creative and do what you want. Can think of creative ways to cheat the puzzle with new abilities instead of the intended way of doing it, making the experience your own. Gives you the ‘I don’t think we are supposed to do that, but it worked!’ moments\\n\\nTemples return. Each one have a companion character which grants you special abilities for that temple/dungeon. Bosses at end of temples are really powerful and not just simple advanced moving puzzles\\n\\n-Menu/UI is more streamline.\\n\\nInventory tabs can be changed via L1 R1 trigger instead of thumbstick. No need to go through multiple pages to get to the next tab. Instead you scroll down if you have a lot of items\\n\\nSettings is at the end of inventory tab instead of a separate page\\n\\nAble to view recipes on sub menu for each item\\n\\n-Story/Plot:\\n\\nLink and Zelda is exploring a unknown area under hyrule castle. They accidentally awaken an mummy and he uses gloom ability to attack them. Link arm and master sword gets infected during initial battle, and the mummy released gloom infecting hyrule. There’s a huge quake and Link both get separated during the scuffle. You wake up and go on a quest to find Zelda, re-forge the master sword and save hyrule.\\n\\nStory is the most expansive than any other Zelda title focusing a lot of character development\\n\\nLike Breath of the Wild; there’s limited voice acting and not fully voiced. But that doesn’t detract from the experience\\n\\n--- Abilities\\n\\n1. Ultra Hand\\n\\nUse this to lift large heavy object and fuse them together. Can use it to solve puzzles lifting heavy objects to build bridges, ramps, ladders, etc) but also use as a vehicle creator for traversal. It’s very similar to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts vehicle creator. Vehicles you create use fuel/battery to operate, collecting/using zonai charges refuels your vehicle giving you the ability to travel longer distances especially when creating gliders. You can also upgrade maximum battery as you progress through he game. Note that our creation despawns if you’re too far away from it, so best not abandon it\\n\\n2. Merge items\\n\\nFuse any two items together in inventory. Mainly use to create weapons with different properties (higher attack, range, elemental damage etc) and increase durability. Seeing weapon durability is back gives players ways to experiment and be resourceful with what they have in their inventory\\n\\nDuring combat you’re able to able to throw individual items\\n\\n3. Asend\\nAble to teleport to above flat platform when directly under it. Some areas are restricted if it’s too high. The cursor on your screen when using ability turns green to indicate if it’s possible to ascend or not\\n\\n4. Recall\\n\\nRewind time for a brief second. Great for puzzle solving like climbing up a rock that fell off the cliff and rewind time to ride it up\\n\\n5. Auto build\\n\\nAble to re-create previous creations you made with ultra-hand. Just have all items in one spot and use ability to re-create it instead of starting from scratch\\n\\n6. Amiibo\\n\\nSimilar to last game, you can in amiibo daily and items will fall in front of you. Amiibo give armor skins, fabrics, and other common items. No exclusive content from Amiibos this time. Able to obtain them via quests. Scanning amiibos just give you them early and more items daily. Disappointed the wolf link amiibo doesn’t give you wolf companion like the last game\\n\\n7. Camera\\n\\nBasically an ability to take pictures to fill out the hyrule compendium\\n\\nOverall extremely fun game giving you freedom to explore and be creative. Best Legend of Zelda game to date.', '9': \"The short version is that this game improves and expands upon Breath of the Wild in every possible way, with the only real con being that this game pushes the Switch to its absolute limit, and you will encounter a very occasional framerate chug. Also they took away my hearty durians!\\n\\nVast amounts of Content:\\n\\nSome were concerned when it was announced this game would utilize the same map from BOTW (its predecessor), so much to the point where it became common to see this game referred to as BOTW DLC prior to its prelease. I can assure you this is not the case. The is the game equivalent of a BMW 1M. Much how like that car was cobbled together from the BMW parts bin, but somehow became one of the best cars they ever made, this game is made with many existing assets and yet surpasses all my expectations. Not only are there sky islands, but their are caves, and an entire other layer of the world to explore (which I won't spoil if you've somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game). There's also more to the story this time, and I swear they've at least doubled the amount of side content.\\n\\nMore enjoyable combat:\\n\\nWhile this game uses the same general combat as BOTW, what's improved is the way you use weapons. They still break if that bothered you before, but I feel far less restricted thanks to the Fuse mechanic, which allows you to combine things with your weapons and shields. The consequence of this is that you feel far less unwilling to use your higher powered weapons. In BOTW I would hoard them, and I still do a little, but I also am at least willing to use them more frequently than before thanks to the fact that I can fuse a weak little stick into something more potent at almost any time. Additionally arrows are far easier to come by, as of writing this I've been on my playthrough for maybe 40-50 hours and have accumulated 200+ arrows without really trying to conserve.\\n\\nNo hearty durians?\\n\\nOk, since I brought it up, I'll make this it's own section. At first I hated this, the magical fruit that restored so much health it was almost gamebreaking in BOTW. However, in hindsight I think it was a good call, as I'm using more of the expanded materials/recipes now and it definitely adds to the game.\\n\\nOther details and conclusion:\\n\\nI hesitate to go into further details on this as it may spoil the experience of discovery, but I can say that the staples of BOTW are still here. Shrines, resource gathering, great fairies, upgrading your armor, all still play a huge role. The runes from the first game are gone, but are replaced with quirkier and largely more useful abilities, although I do miss the bombs. But even the function of the old remote bomb can be replicated in no less than three ways, depending on the situation. I have not beaten the game, but I have spent about 40-50 hours in this world by my estimate and completed three of the four major temples, and revealed the entire main map. Yet, despite that I feel like I'm still just scratching the surface. There have still been a few new enemy types that I still have no idea how to take down, or I need to collect more hearts/better armor. There is so much to see and do in this game, and so far it's all been very entertaining. I've been playing Zelda since Link's Awakening on Gameboy Color, and although this game like BOTW diverts somewhat from the classic formula, it is definitely in the lead for my favorite Zelda game of all time, and possibly my favorite open world game of all time. Truly fantastic.\", '10': 'The bar was high enough with BoTW, yet Nintendo managed to beat its record. Tears of the Kingdom is a fantastic game, full of new features, and the in-world experiences are satisfying.\\nBelow the PRO and CONS\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nAwesome Gameplay\\nThe gameplay surpasses the experience you may have playing Breath of the Wild. You can spend countless hours building stuff to help you explore or solve puzzles. The possibilities are infinite.\\n\\nRefreshing Changes\\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things fresh. You\\'ll often find yourself wondering about the transformed towns and the whereabouts of familiar characters.\\n\\nDeep Dive in Hyrule History\\n-Though not groundbreaking, the story adds depth to the game. I have been a fan of Zelda since the first game on NES, and the lore we learn in TotK connects with BotW and provides more information about past games. I am in love with Zelda\\'s development as a character, from being a \"damsel in distress\" to becoming the reason why this franchise is called The Legend of Zelda.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nDisconnect from BOTW\\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven\\'t experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they\\'ve never met you. It\\'s not a deal-breaker, but it is an odd design choice.\\n\\nThis is a must-play game for hardcore fans and casual players alike.'}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'total_index', '_id': 'S-eqc40B-Q_i0rt4Qkze', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Just Dance 2024 Edition - Amazon Exclusive Bundle | Nintendo Switch (Code in Box & Ubisoft Connect Code)', 'Product Price': '19', 'Product Rating': '4.0', 'Product Number of Rates': '291 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/719rfs3UNAL._SY445_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Just Dance 2024 Edition features 40 songs, from the latest hits and beloved classics including \"Flowers\" by Miley Cyrus, \"Tití Me Preguntó\" by Bad Bunny, \"How You Like That” by BLACKPINK, and \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" by Whitney Houston!

', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'I’ve been a Just Dance fan ever since the first game, and honestly? I love this Just Dance interface and way of playing the game much better than the previous ones. It’s much cleaner, prettier & you can customize your character and play with your friends so much easier.\\n\\nI can access the previous game, 2023’s, whole track list without having to get up and switch my cartridge out. A problem I had with previous games was that if I didn’t have Just Dance Unlimited, I’d have to switch games. With the games becoming codes & being unlockable editions in the central Just Dance app, it’s easy to find my songs. And 2024 is there as well right beside it so there’s no complication, everything is set up really simply.', '2': 'I purchased this for my grandkids who love to have a nightly dance party. They will love this game on Nintendo Switch and also get some exercise. Fun and Fitness!!', '3': \"Where to start.... 1) You must have wifi connection to even attempt to play the game. 2) When trying to play the game, none of the song/dances will even start. Their servers will not load any of the content. Check other reviews (which I should have done first) as it is a widespread problem. An absolute trash/broken game with no immediate fix in site. Save the hassle and don't buy this 2024 version. Go for one of the older years.\", '4': 'Did not pay attention it was a game with no card and I have to download it. But it’s working good…it’s fun!', '5': \"When I opened box, I found that there was no card in it. I thought it was used item and resent to me. I was very disappointed and requested replacement right away. Later I checked the box again, find out it supposed has no card, only the downloaded code. I'm old-schooled and like to use cards that are simple and don't take up memory. And if the card doesn't include it, write it in a clear place, because having a card or not is very important to me.\", '6': \"Yes, starting from Just Dance 3 I've been a fan of this game and ever since then I always got the game and been playing it. Getting this one was a must for me. The box art is pretty, and I like the way I can still collect my Just Dance boxes and play the game!\", '7': 'I’m proud to add Just Dance 2024 to my ever growing Just Dance collection. As a hardcore just dance fan, it is encouraging to see that this series is still going strong. Here are some of the top highlights:\\n\\nCAMERA SUPPORT\\nYes you read that right! Camera support for cellphones is coming back! It will be available this winter for beta testing!\\n\\nWORKOUT MODE\\nWith accompanying workout tailored choreographies (well, there are two so far) you can now track your calories across any Just Dance/Just Dance + Song! This was a heavily requested feature, I’m glad it’s back!\\n\\nCHALLENGE MODE\\nYou can now challenge other players scores! You will play against their score to encourage you to climb higher on the world leaderboard! But watch out - others can challenge your score too!\\n\\nSTORY PLAYLIST SEQUEL\\nLast year, one of the main highlights was the “Enter the Danceverses” playlist. This year, we have a sequel to that adventure - “Dance with the Swan”. And uh, well…I’ll let you play it to find out what happens….\\n\\nWhile lots of people have been complaining about “reusing” coaches/backgrounds, I honestly don’t mind it. I get connections with characters, so to see them again is great! (Especially with all the lore going around…) all in all this is a great addition to the JD franchise! Can’t wait for the new year!', '8': 'Just dance 2024 is an improvement from just dance 2023, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. While they have finally added some more modes such has workout mode (which counts the calories you burn) and was called sweat mode in just dance 2022 it is still not in just dance 2023.\\n\\nThey have also added a challenge mode where you issue a challenge to another player to see who can get a better score on a dance. You can issues challenges to players on your friend list or anyone on the leader boards on any songs. You can also go into your settings and change it where you only accept challenges on your friends list if you do not want any random challenges. You can only access challenge mode if you’re playing online. You do not need Nintendo switch online membership to play online on any just dance games.\\n\\nThe game also has song sharing a feature that allows just dance 2024 to share the base game song list to their friends who have just dance 2023. If you want to dance to songs on the just dance + then both players must have the just dance + subscription. Which is $25 for one year.\\n\\nJust dance 2024 says they will have ongoing updates but at the time of release they are still missing the feature of create your own playlist, and the world dance floor an online mode where players from around the world dance to songs in a tournament and try to beat one another. Both of these are available on just dance 2022.\\n\\nJust dance 2024 will come has a digital code that must be redeemed on the Nintendo store. If you prefer a physical copy then you can buy just dance 2022 since the franchise has gone to digital only for the Nintendo switch editions since just dance 2023.\\n\\nWith the purchase of the game you’ll get one month of just dance + for free. afterwards you’ll need to pay a separate fee to access all the songs. you will have to go to the just dance + tab on the left to activate your one month free trial.\\n\\nUnfortunately just like with just dance 2023 you will need to make an Ubisoft account to access the game and get certain emotes and avatars. This is why I will recommend just dance 2022 to people who want to just dance and not bother with making additional accounts to play a game.\\n\\nI would recommend getting just dance 2022 since it has just dance unlimited the old subscription service to the just dance games.\\n\\nThe difference between just dance unlimited and just dance + is that just dance + is the new subscription service available for just dance 2023 and 2024 while unlimited is for all the other older just dance games meaning it has more songs! Just dance unlimited has over 700 whole just dance + has maybe 300.\\n\\nUnfortunately they have now deactivated just dance unlimited and just dance 2022 only has the 40 songs that come with the game.', '9': \"My star rating is for the gameplay itself not the other issues I'm about to talk about. So, with that said, I have to say that the lack of an option to buy a physical copy of the game really bugs me. I love collecting my little switch game cartridges and I have noticed a little lag a couple times while playing.\\n\\nBUT\\n\\nI do enjoy the game, it is fun, and looks good. There are some great song choices however I get really tired of in game ads for the Just Dance+ subscription. I shouldn't be bombarded with that every time I play after buying the dang game.\", '10': \"I initially thought the code for the extra content came in-box but it doesn't. It gets emailed to you after it ships. I see all the reviews claiming they were lied to. They weren't. They just didn't check their emails. Also I love the fact that Just Dance 2024 adds on its content to 2023. No more clunkiness. But I do want them to add back battles and World Dance Floor.\"}, 'Related Products': []}}]}}\n"

This game has you going around in many unique worlds, running around freely as you did in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The fans asked and Nintendo delivered. Mario is finally back and he\\'s here to save the 3D platforming genre. With that being said, hold onto your fedoras, because we\\'re jumping right into the review. Also, I will try to be as spoiler free as I can.\\n\\nStory: For the 800th time, our job is to help Mario rescue his (girlfriend?) Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser. Only this time, Bowser is forcing Peach into marriage.\\n\\nControls (basic): Mario\\'s running speed is is between Super Mario Sunshine\\'s and Galaxy\\'s. I think this speed is perfect, allowing for the appropriate reaction time. A plethora of Mario\\'s athletic tricks are back such as the triple jump and somersault. I have to point out how much easier it is to perform the triple jump in this game. The window between the jumps have been lengthened, so casual gamers will enjoy this. They\\'ve also added a few new jumping techniques such as the ground pound jump that gives you an extra boost in height once you flatten an enemy with your bum. The diving and long jump also make a return from Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario 64. HOWEVER, long-time fans may be displeased to find out they\\'re somewhat nerfed. For example, the long jump is much shorter than it was in 64 and the dive doesn\\'t allow you to continuously slide like it did in Sunshine. But, down frown yet. They\\'ve brought back the rolling technique from Mario 3D World that allows you to continuously roll by tapping the button. It\\'s perfect for traversing large areas. Next, I gotta tackle the swimming controls You tap the button to float up and release to float down (similar to super mario sunshine, but no longer clunky). Pressing the ZL and Y buttons together will let you zoom straight for a second, but it always doesn\\'t register for some reason. You often accidentally ground pound, which is frustrating when you\\'re running out of air or racing for a moon. I prefer the Mario 64 swimming controls.\\n\\nControls (Cappy): I have to devote a whole section of this review to the Cappy controls because they have such an influence on the game experience. Throw Cappy with Y and this little guy can manipulate all kinds of enemies and objects. Holding Y will make Cappy spin in place, allowing for a chance to do some hat-jump techniques. These techniques make the game so much more fun to play. Advanced players will have fun throwing cappy over gaps, long jumping over to him, bouncing off of him and diving to the other side. There are a bunch of more tricks you can do, so I hope you\\'ll try to perform them. When you throw Cappy at an enemy, you posses- I mean, capture them and can make their abilities yours. This allows for a bunch of unique playstyles and Nintendo did a splendid job incorporating them into the game.\\n\\nMotion Controls :I know people are tired of hearing us complain about motion controls in Nintendo games, but part of being a reviewer is being critical. I found the motion controls to be pretty unresponsive most of the time when playing with a Pro Controller. Trying to do a downward throw with Cappy almost never works and jerking the whole controller to the right for a spin move isn\\'t comfortable nor functional all of the time. Keep in mind motion controls ARE NOT REQUIRED to complete the game. However, some of Mario\\'s moves are locked behind them. For example, there\\'s no button mapping for throwing Cappy upward/downward. But, they could\\'ve used the L or R buttons easily. For example, L+Y+up could\\'ve been a combination for throwing Cappy skyward. Also, there are instances where shaking the whole controller/tablet makes you jump/climb faster, which isn\\'t a big deal. But why not hold the Y button or something to speed up, ya know?\\n\\nObjective of the game: Odyssey is a collect-a-thon game. You travel to different areas and collect Power Moons, which allow you to travel to even more places and so on. Note this game is not mission based like the other 3D Marios. When you collect a moon, you don\\'t get booted out of the level. It\\'s more in the line of Banjo Kazooie. There\\'s a big world and you\\'re free to run around until you get enough moons, then you go to the next kingdom. Each Kingdom has generally 20 or more moons. Note that there is post game content that increases the number of moons available to collect. Here\\'s the critical part. Some moons require a little elbow grease to get, but a lot are just thrown right in your face and take only 10-30 seconds to get, which alleviates the sense of accomplishment the other 3D Mario\\'s had. This may not be a big deal to newcomers, but as a long-time Mario fan, I had to point it out.\\n\\nScale of the game: Unlike Super Mario 64 and Sunshine, Odyssey DOES NOT have a hub-world. You select kingdoms in a world-map kind of style. The game consists of 15 Kingdoms. A handful of which are disappointingly small in comparison to others. For example, 2 kingdoms mostly serve as the arena for their respective boss battles and some Kingdoms consist mostly of linear areas with barely any open areas to explore. There are 4 kingdoms (in my opinion) that are the appropriate size. if the other kingdoms could be the size of these 4, then I\\'d be much more pleased with the game. Despite what I\\'ve said, there is a point in the game where you go back and collect more moons from every kingdom, which adds to their content.\\n\\nDifficulty: I\\'m a Mario veteran and I completely understand that Ninty wants this game to be accessible for all ages. But, it\\'s pretty upsetting to me how much easier they made this game compared to the other 3D Mario games and I\\'m not even talking about the \"assist mode\", which was literally put in the game for younger kids. I\\'m talking about the regular mode. One big change is the removal of lives, which honestly isn\\'t even the reason I\\'m mad. Game Overs are more of an inconvenience than anything because in cases like Super Mario Galaxy or what have you, the game just kicks you to the title screen and your progress is saved. However, in the case of Super Mario Odyssey, the game is a cakewalk even without game overs. You\\'ll almost never die from losing heart points because collecting moons will instantly refill them (moons are literally everywhere btw) and not only that, there are Heart point expansions in every kingdom that you can buy with coins. The Bosses are just plain disappointing, as well. Some are clever, but having the same strategy repeated 3 times is just getting old. Note that there is post-game content that offers a better challenge, but we should be able to change the difficulty at will.\\n\\nGame length/replay value: The main campaign length is pretty short. It\\'s very much possible to finish the story by getting the minimum required moons and zooming through each kingdom, which takes about 7 hours (for an experienced player such as myself). BUT, that\\'s not how the game is meant to be enjoyed. \"Replay\" is this game\\'s middle name. Once you finish the story, even more moons and areas open up. These moons offer a harder challenge, as I mentioned earlier. Not only that, the kingdoms you\\'ve already visited get harder challenges. I\\'ve been playing this game for over a month and can confirm there\\'s a truck load of things to do. I\\'m looking to 100% this game and I\\'m just a little over halfway there. You won\\'t believe how many moons they stuffed in this game.\\n\\nTo conclude, this game is a must-have for the Switch regardless of the flaws I\\'ve listed. It\\'s chock-full of content and is still one of the best games on the system. Easily worth 60 bucks. But, get it cheaper if you can. This game is built around both casuals and experienced gamers. So, if you\\'ve never played a Mario game before, you will probably have a better experience than me since everything will be a surprise. And to veterans, there are still gonna be surprises that\\'ll make your jaw drop. Plus, the references to past Mario games will make you smile and remember the good old times when we didn\\'t have to work and pay bills. Anyway, thanks for reading and happy gaming.', '2': \"**The following review is rather in-depth, and longer than the average amazon review. I tried to keeps spoilers minimal. Just an FYI, now onto the review.**\\n\\nSuper Mario Odyssey is the best reason to go out and buy a Nintendo Switch right now. It is, hands down, one of the best Mario games ever made, and one of the best 3-D Platformers I have ever played. Even after you “beat” the game, there is so much more to do. The game manages to recapture the old, sandbox style 3-D Platformer that we saw in Super Mario 64, Sunshine, and games like Banjo Kazooie. Odyssey manages to update and modernize the concept, and tweak it to near perfection. No doubt about it, Odyssey is a must own. With that to say, I hope you enjoy my review for this incredible game!\\n\\nStory: Story has never been a Mario game’s strong suit. Odyssey isn’t too different. The game opens-up with Mario fighting Bowser, a fight which Mario loses. Bowser then kidnaps princess Peach yet again, only this time he also captures Peach’s sentient hat, known as “Tiara,” and plans a wedding for him and Peach. Mario meets a sentient hat named Cappy. Cappy is able to take control of, and poses different creatures and objects (Mario meets the exorcist.) Mario and Cappy use an air-ship called the “Odyssey” in order to trot the globe in a quest to sabotage Bowser and Peach’s sinister wedding. The story is very bare-bones, but it gets the ball rolling; once the ball rolls, it doesn’t stop.\\n\\nPresentation:\\n\\nSuper Mario Odyssey is truly a feast for the eyes. Every kingdom you go to is a wonder to look at, from the cascade kingdom with its prehistoric look, to the Hispanic style sand kingdom with its “Day of the Dead,” themed aesthetic, to the snow kingdom, the wooded kingdom and it’s sentient gardening tools, the luncheon kingdom (yumm,) and especially the New York inspired Metro Kingdom. Each kingdom that Mario visits looks incredible, and has a unique visual style. The texture and lighting design are also extremely impressive, the frame-rate is very solid.\\n\\nThe music is outstanding. There is great variety in musical styles, and the game features many instrumental themes. You’ll hear very ambient sound effects in one stage, songs befitting of a beach in other stages, and even a folk-style song in the wooded kingdom. One kingdom has a Japanese palace inspired musical score; the music can get quite epic towards the last few kingdoms in the game, similar to the Super Mario Galaxy games. The game even features songs with actual singing, such as the surprisingly catchy “Jump Up Super star,” which you hear during a celebration in “New Donk City.” The sound effects also perfectly blended with the controls, and the gameplay. The menu is also very slick, and the Switch functionality allows you to pause the game and jump right back into it at any time. Presentation wise, this game is a winner through and through.\\n\\nGameplay: Controls for Super Mario Odyssey are fantastic, and very intuitive. The controls for Mario are similar too how they have been in previous 3-D Mario adventures. Simply running around as Mario, and jumping is so much fun. My favorite new mechanic is the ability for Mario to roll like a ball, which is especially fun in the sandy and hilly areas. While some have had issues with them, I have found the joy-con motion controls to be precise and very fun. The camera in this game is much better than in previous titles, but it still has its occasional issues in certain areas. These issues are few and far between, however. The controls are all in all very responsive and as fun as ever.\\n\\nCompared to recent Mario games, Odyssey has a much more open-ended, sand-box design to it. As was mentioned earlier, you travel to different kingdoms such as the Cascade, Sand, Forest, Snow, Metro, Beach, Forest, and other kingdoms in order to chase down Bowser and his new lackeys, the “Broodal Bruddas, (bunny like creatures.”) Each kingdom has its own residents, and even interesting world-building aspects that flesh them out. For example, the luncheon kingdom has living utensils, while the snow kingdom has polar bears. The sea-side kingdom has snails, while the Metro Kingdom has actual people. These unique aspects make every kingdom exciting and interesting in its own way. The main gameplay itself consists of exploring these kingdoms, and searching for Power Moons (think the stars in Mario 64/Galaxy, or the jiggies in Banjo Kazooie,) in order to power up the Odyssey ship and travel to the next kingdom. You acquire said moons by exploring every nook and cranny in the kingdom, solving little puzzles, fighting bosses, doing menial tasks, participating in minigames, and more. Some of the power moons are scripted, particularly early on, but most of them are not. For a game with such an open-ended nature, there is tons of variety to the gameplay. You might be controlling a T-Rex one moment, riding a golden lion another moment, balancing on a giant corn-cob, or even riding a motorcycle through the streets of New Donk City. The variety is stunning, and keeps the gameplay from getting boring.\\n\\nThe real gameplay hook for this Mario adventure is the ability to use Mario’s hat to control, and possess different objects, creatures, and even some people. It may seem a little weird and creepy at first, but the execution is ingenious, in a way only Nintendo can pull off. You can literally take control of several Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Hammer Bros, Fire Balls, Tanks, Frogs, and even a T-rex. You can even take control of certain inanimate objects, and even some of the humans in New Donk City. This switches up the Gameplay almost infinitely, but in a way that always feels very organic, introducing so many unique and clever moments that never cease to be fun. Just goofing off and experimenting with this mechanic is half the fun in and of itself.\\n\\nThe boss fights, many of which incorporate the possession mechanic, are all very fun and well designed. The end-game fight in particular is a high point among the impressive array of boss fights that the game has to offer. One of the most surprising boss fights you will encounter is a dragon that looks like it’s straight out of Game of Thrones. While a few of the bosses are challenging, many of the fights feel rather easy, and are a breeze to defeat. Some of this is due to the fact that there is no longer a “game over,” as you simply loose coins when you die. The boss fights are still tons of fun all around. Speaking of coins, you can use them to purchase different outfits, power stars, and other goodies. Some of these outfits have some actual gameplay use, but many of them feel like window dressing, though it helps spruce up your ship none-the-less.\\n\\nWhat is so incredible about this game is that after the credits, you feel like you have only just begun. The replay value for this Mario game is absurdly high, and the possibilities open-up a ton after you finish the story, which should take you around fifteen hours in and of itself. The gameplay is also perfectly suited for being able to play in small doses if you have a job and a busy schedule (as I do,) but you can also play to your heart's content when you wish to, on the weekends in my case. The Gameplay really is about as close to perfect as you could hope for a 3-D Platformer to be!\\n\\nVerdict: Super Mario Odyssey is a celebration of more than thirty years of Super Mario. The game encapsulates what Mario has always been about: Pure fun. More than that, though, the game innovates and surprises long after you “beat” it. I certainly see myself playing this game for several more weeks to come. This game is the number one reason to purchase a Nintendo Switch if you have not done so already (They’re still hard to find.) This game truly is the best 3-D Platformer I have played in years, even giving Galaxy 2 a run for its money; it is one of the very best games that our favorite Italian plumber has ever been in. So go out, buy this game, and participate in an incredible, one-of-a-kind, globe-trotting “Odyssey.”\\n\\nCons:\\nEasy initial difficulty\\nOccasional camera issues\\nSub-par plot\\n\\nPros:\\nBeautiful visuals and design\\nAmazing music\\nGreat sound effects\\nTight and responsive controls\\nWonderful Sand-Box style Mario Gameplay\\nIncredible and ingenious level design and scenarios\\nQuirky and fun characters\\nTons of variety\\nUnbelievably high replay-value\\nOne of the best Mario games ever made\\n\\nOverall: 10/10\\nPeace, Dana\", '3': 'Mario Odessey is easily the most hyped Mario since Mario 64. Unlike some, I refected on my opinion and changed with time. Now I\\'ve beaten every major Mario release excluding the Galaxy games. My first introduction to Mario is my earliest memory. Xmas 85 my step grandfather won a NES at a party a couple days before that they got from the original Nintendo test launch. Every adult was jumping while distracted by a scrolling thing. It was so odd how excited they were. Mario World brought graphics and multiple buttons for the best controls at the time. Mario 64 rewrote 3d gaming, acing 3d platforming on its first go and changing how we looked at 3d games. For Odessey I ignored all gameplay and trailers after the E3 presentation as to go in fresh. I judge this as a Mario game so I\\'m extra critical. So does it live up to the hype?\\nAlmost... Gameplay first and it is snappy. The games features dynamic resolution to achieve 60 frames per second. In the PC community there is a saying,\"Give me 60 or give me death.\" It makes the game control easier, panning the camera and motion is smooth. This makes controlling Mario top notch. Never did I die and think it was the games fault. In fact the input timing at 60fps is so good, going to xenoblade 2 or BotW makes them feel delayed in comparison. The new hat mechanic is an interesting new twist, but at the cost of power ups. Which I did miss. It is fun controlling the enemies, and each have different capabilities to help progress and find moons. Eh the moons. The single laziest thing in the game. There are hundreds of them but you only need a fraction of that to beat the main game and you can buy moons. Yes you can buy moons if you can\\'t get to 600+ on your own. So it\\'s easy to get them and it turns into a collection thing. Collect golden coins, stage coins, moons to collect more stuff. Though I did enjoy getting many of the moons for their challenge they could be replaced with a lot of coins considering I can just buy them. The hat can also whip around using motion to beat lower enemies. It\\'s all well polished, but the motion feels odd at best. The 2d parts are fun but very short. There were moments where I thought this was well thought out or this is really cool, but never did I say WOW! How did they do that?\\nFor the game itself. There are coins that you can spend on a shop or death. There are stage coins that buy fitting stage outfits as well as decorations which are useless. Just more busy work. You are trying to save Peach again. Three hit bosses. Very typical. The stages are short. Like not any larger than some Mario 64 stages and there are not that many stages either. The t rex can only be used in a very limited section. This is the main problem of the whole game. Where the fun factor is high, it only lasts 15-20 hours max then you just get moments from then on. I beat the game in under 10hours, and I was exploring. Even the collecting busy work took me 30 hours to get enough to go to the real last stage. Botw lasted me 100 of hours of new exploration. This is padding pure and simple. Level design though small is well polished with a lot of secrets. The level design is the best of any platformers ever but it really really could have used a larger open area to each stage.\\nGraphics are just decent. Look a lot of compromises have been made to achieve 60fps. Mario and npcs look good, as well as locations, but textures and draw distances are poor. Pop in is really bad and the stages are smaller than you would think. Art style can only hide so much.\\nSound is excellent. There is no voice acting, but the music and sound effects are stellar.\\nSo is Odessey a good Mario game? Yes, however it feels very restrained and easy. That is until the real last stage where it gets very unforgiving to the point it doesn\\'t fit with the rest of the game. In fact with that exception, I think this is accually the easiest Mario yet and gimicky. My kids will have no problem playing this, but even glossing over that. I can\\'t let some nostalgia moments make me forget how short this is and small the \"worlds\" feel.. This is not the best game ever, not a chance, it\\'s not even the best Mario it just tries to remind us of them. Mario3/World are probably the best givend their eras. But it\\'s good. Really good. Like an instant classic and better than Sunshine or anyother modern Mario good. I liked using enemies powers, but it doesn\\'t carry an entire game. It would have been great to get a flying power or jump on Yoshi. Costumes are a cute idea and thank the stars amiibo are not needed. After BotW this might be the second best game of the year. That said it\\'s a fairly distant 2nd for me. But trounced Horizon or anything else. I can\\'t see a bunch of adults excited to play this like the first game. Nor is it mind blowing like Mario 64. Its not revolutionary. Even Cappy kind of mimics Kirby. It\\'s an easy buy, replay value is good and its a perfect platformer. Simply the best 3d platformer. I just wish there where more of it.', '4': 'I have not had this much fun with a Mario game since Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64 system when it came out back in the days. Hands down the best, most true-to-character Mario game in recent history. This is the essence of what a platform game should be and Nintendo should be proud of themselves for taking their beloved franchise to new levels. Green Mushrooms for all!\\n\\nHonestly, I grew up playing Nintendo. The NES started video gaming for me. And I owned every nintendo system outside of handhelds and the Wii U. However, during my late teens and early 20\\'s, I shifted into playing more \"hardcore\" games on systems like PS2, PS3, PS4, etc.etc. Initially I owned a Wii, but hardly spent any time with it. Basically, I have been out of the Mario scene for some time. The Switch changed that for me.\\n\\nMario Odyssey rules. Here is the general gist of what this game is all about:\\n\\nBowser steals Peach (like always) and wants to force her to marry him (like always). Peach has a little animated princess crown companion that just happens to be the heartthrob of Mario\\'s animated hat companion, Cappy. Of course, Mario gotta get his girl back and Cappy is more than happy to oblige helping Mario do this by way of providing Mario new skills. Motivated to help Mario acheive his goals, Cappy brings a new dimension of play in multiple ways.\\n\\nMario\\'s mission is to travel between different themed worlds in his quest to chase down Bowser. Marios does this aboard a glorified hot air baloon that is powered by a resourced called Moons. Each world has a plethora of moons; some in plain view, some tied to \"quests\" and a WHOLE BUNCH that are hidden behind secret walls, portals, mini games, etc. Collect enough Moons on each world and it unlocks travel to the next world. So on and so forth till you catch up to Bowser.\\n\\nCappy brings a bunch of new mechanics to Odyssey beyond just being a nifty weapon to use against baddies. Cappy allows you to use elements in the environment to \"possess\" things that allow you to get around each unique world Mario visits. Sometimes you can possess switches that propel you along walls like a rubber band. Other times you can possess power lines and travel as a ball of lightning to different areas. And sometimes you can use Cappy to open doors into challenges that you have to complete hatless and without his help. These can be especially challenging and really give you an appreciation for what Cappy can do for you. The old addage \"you can never truly appreciate something until its gone\" really rings your bell during these challenges.\\n\\nThe idea of Cappy being this chameleon companion that can also possess certain types of enemies is pretty cool. I have always wondered what it would be like to be a dreaded goomba (many a killer of Mario) or a fireball-spitting venus fly trap. There is quite a feeling of gratitude when you can finally turn your enemy\\'s weapons against them! For so long I HATED getting fireballed or eaten by those dang venus fly traps popping out of pipes!!!\\n\\nThere are also some new enemies for Mario to deal with, as well, and they play an important role in Mario\\'s new adventure. The true GENIUS of this enemy-possessing ability is making it part of the puzzle. The enemies you possess become integral to unlocking secrets and progressing through each world. In fact, you cannot progress without this mechanic.\\n\\nWhether its possessing fish in an underwater tunnel to keep Mario from drowning or using Cappy\\'s Exorcist-style mind control on a frying pan flinging turtleshell so you can destroy giant blocks of cheese YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The ridiculous level of fun never ends.\\n\\nOutside of using Cappy for all the cool above-mentioned things, the platform experience is truly on point. This IS a Mario game, afterall. Nintendo has even managed to fit in a nice little throwback to the early Mario days via pipes spread out across the different worlds that teleport you to an old-school version of Mario in bit-style graphics armed with only your jump button. Truly retro. Oh, and to top it off, you transform into your 8-bit version WITH your current costume on.\\n\\nOh, did I forget costumes?? Yes indeed. You can change Mario\\'s outfit to personalize his looks and to also unlock secret areas that require you to be dressed a certain way.\\n\\nThe only wish I have for this game is some of the worlds are rather short lived experiences and I wish there was more content. Also, you are forced to travel in a linear fashion from world-to-world even when the road \"forks\" and you are given a choice which one you want to visit first. Even though it would seem like there is a \"progression\" going on, each world is disjointed and theres no real overall \"theme\" to the game other than collecting Moons and chasing Bowser. I never felt like any one world was \"easier\" than the other; there are just different and surprising mechanics going on in each world. This makes each one feel really unique and whimsical, but doesnt lend itself to a cohesive story. The boss fights also become redundant and predictable after a while.\\n\\nWhile there are a lot of extra Moons you can squeeze out of each world, and you are free to travel between already unlocked worlds, I dont see a lot of replayability in this game other than being a \"completionist\" and really digging to get every list completed. Dont let that detract you from playing, however. This game will constantly surprise you!\\n\\nHats off to Nintendo (yes I punned you there) for bringing me back to Mario land. Buy this game NOW!', '5': \"This game is an open world Mario game similar to Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine giving you a lot of freedom to explore.\\n\\nThere is so much to do: so many side objectives and collectables within viewing distance that it's sometimes overwhelming at first since it's hard to stay on objective with teasers keeping you off the beaten path. With that said, this game is filled with content and let's you progress at your own pace. If you rush through the main campaign it will last you around 10 hours, which opens up even more levels and collectables via post game content. To do everything it can last 100s of hours if you explore on your own without any online guides/tips. There are coin collectables you can use to purchase new clothes for Mario or cosmetics for you ship. Collectables feels more like rewards for discovery rather than a collect-a-thon, and at no point does it feel that the game is hand-holding you through it with it's natural progression system.\\n\\nLove the visuals with its amazing vistas in full HD, especially on TV mode. There's a lot of personality in the characters as the emote very well via animated body movement or facial expressions. You can snapshot the game at anytime and see Mario's various reactions\\n\\nWriting/dialogue is very good, or at least whimsical as there are fun micro stories among characters within levels. Main plot is generic, but you don't play a Mario game for the story (except for the Mario RPG series). Bowser captures Peach and tries to wed her, but wants to collect all the best gifts from different kingdoms. You play as Mario and try to stop the forced wedding from happening.\\n\\nMusic is also very good, including orchestral music along with some having vocals . I like how the music complements what you're doing and where you are. For instance if you reach the peak of a high tower, the music cuts off and all you hear the wind blowing.\\n\\nNo power ups, but with your pal cappy able to take control of any enemy Captain Ginyu style (Dragon Ball Z reference). All enemies feel vastly different from each other from attacking to solving puzzles/collecting out of reach items. There are 50 to collect/capture .\\nPower moons main collectables in the game (883 Total), which powers your ship to travel to new kingdoms/worlds. There's a nice enycopedia/log of time stamped moons you collected and where you obtained them via check mark on the map screen. Love the map design as it's displayed like an amusement park pamphlet with description of landmarks/attractions. There's also a fast travel feature when you reach a flag checkpoint, as you can warp between them.\\n\\nThere are also region exclusive currency (purple coins) to collect, which unlocks costumes for that specific region you collected the coins in.\\nMario controls more fluid than ever before, especially with his new momentum based roll, and ability to do toss and springboard off cappy\\nNo 1up system. When you die you lose 10 coins and respawn instantly. Coins are valuable as they can be used to purchase game tips for 50 coins each, costumes/cosmetics that can be upwards to 1,000 coins each, moons for 100 coins each, among other things\\nMotion controls. Some shaking is involved, but it's very minimal and only required in a few levels/mini-games. Feels odd shaking the whole system in handheld mode though\\n\\nThere's co-op where one player controls Mario and the other Cappy. This is not a full fledged co-op affair as the person who plays cappy has a similar experience as moving the cursor around in Mario Galaxy.\\n\\n2D segments are pretty neat with Mario changing into his 8 or 16bit counterpart attached to the wall around a 3D backdrop.\\nTons of mini-games to be had; some utilizing the cap capture mechanic as well as traditional Mario platforming. There's also an online leadboard for how may times Mario can jump rope.\\n\\nBoss battles are very creative as they're a fun puzzle in itself, using a hat transformation you used through the entire level to defeat the boss.\\n\\nAmiibo. There are wedding Mario, Bowser and Peach Amiibo which unlocks costumes and help you find moons. These costumes are not locked via these amiibo, and can be purchased via in-game coins\\n\\nOverall, most fun a had playing video games in a while. Get ready for a fun filled adventure\", '6': 'Just finished the game. I liked it. Had some fine highlights. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be replaying it again for a while. I don\\'t care about getting all the moons. The ending was fine. Nice touch of feminism there.\\n\\nFrom the online posts, lots of people are saying this is better than Breath of the Wild. Hmm I don\\'t think so. It\\'s more colorful than Breath of the Wild. I\\'ll give it that. And it is more enjoyable to explore the open worlds of Super Mario Odyssey than BOTW Hyrule, because you dont have to worry about a camouflaged octorok popping out of nowhere pelleting you with rocks.\\n\\nBut as far as Super Mario Odyssey goes, it\\'s pretty good. There\\'s a lot of fluff and presentation. It gives homage to the history of Mario. Sometime you\\'re playing a 3d game, then it will revert back to a retro 2d platformer. There are some fantastic moments. Such as when you\\'re playing ARMS against bowser. There\\'s also the jazz scene in New Donk City, the DK throwback sequence.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some good gameplay too. This is the most complicated mario yet. He has a moveset from a fighting game, with lots of different jumps, rolls, and combos. You have to execute the right button presses to get to all the areas. But that\\'s not a far cry from what we had to do in the first mario games. You did have to press the right buttons at the right time to traverse the world of obstacles and pit falls. Yet this game also has the option of being simple as you can select assist mode, if you are having difficulty. So the youngest of all kids can play and have fun. That\\'s how the first Mario game got me on the NES. I was a kid and it was a lot of fun and now I\\'m a \"physically\" a grown man and Im still playing Mario.\\n\\nAs I was playing, at times, I felt like I was playing a Disney Infinity toybox level, which is not a compliment. The desert level feels like this especially. It feels like the developers put a boring desert map, then they put in a smattering of points to visit, and that\\'s it. When you\\'re at Point A it\\'s interesting, when you\\'re at Point B it\\'s interesting, but when you\\'re going from Point A to Point B, it\\'s not interesting. It\\'s pretty uninspired. It\\'s not tied in together well, is what I\\'m saying. It\\'s a mixed bag. Some worlds are great. Some not so much.\\n\\nThe motion controls are pretty good. you can shake your joy cons around and it lets you throw your hat better. there\\'s also at least one boss battle, where you can use the motion controls as you would in ARMS, and punch bowser. which is so so satisfying. I really really love motion controls. It really makes it immersive.\\n\\nI like the amiibo integration as well. It lets you get different costumes, which is fun. And you can use them mid game, you potentially restore your hearts.\\n\\nWell I think that\\'s about all I can say about the game. It\\'s a good one I feel. Worth buying. Now that I beat the game, I wouldn\\'t mind trading it in for another game. There is a post game, i.e. collecting all the moons. but meh. don\\'t really feel like doing that.', '7': \"Good game, not perfect.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\nI really enjoy finding all of the fun little easter eggs scattered everywhere and anywhere throughout the vast array of kingdoms Mario can explore.\\nThe new mechanic of Mario throwing his cap and capturing enemies to gain their powers is a nice little addition to Mario. I am a big fan of Kirby, and it doesn't seem like we're going to get an open world Kirby game for Switch, at least not soon. So this is kind of a nice compromise. Mario with a just a hint of Kirby. Turning into a T-Rex is just as fun as the trailers made it look.\\nAlthough there isn't as much to be seen from your old favorites like the Shy Guys, Koopas, etc. I really enjoy some of the new NPC's. I especially like the skeleton heads (Dia de Los Muertos) type characters in Toastarena and the Robots of the Wooded Kingdom. Some of the great iconic moments of this game include these NPCs, like finding yourself in a secret room rocking out on your guitar with them.\\nThe two player is really interesting. At first glance, having one player control Mario, and the other control Cappy seems like you'd have some much watered down gameplay, but that isn't necessarily the case. Cappy is able to move around freely as your player 2 and can jump and explore and even ground pound like Mario. To be honest, if anything, Mario feels a little crippled in the 2 player without being able to freely use Cappy. However, this is made up for somewhat by the fact that some new jumping possibilities exist when you play cooperatively with your player 2 controlling Cappy. It emphasizes that Cappy is a living being and an integral part of the story, but I still miss Luigi... I mean as a little brother it was demoralizing to have to play as Luigi...now little bros get to be a hat...\\n\\nWhat I dislike:\\nEarlier, I applauded the plethora of Easter Eggs. They are a blessing and a curse. They are very different games, but Odyssey will continue to inevitably draw comparisons to Breath of the Wild. While the Easter Eggs in Breath of the Wild made the journey that much more exciting and full-bodied, the Easter Eggs in Odyssey seem like they ARE mostly the objective. The story line is fairly weak so far, so the game makers had to compensate for that by adding a seemingly endless number of collectibles. Every stage is formulaic. Bowser took whatever random wedding thing, you have to get it back...blah blah.\\nAside from that, the power moons feel really inconsistent. You sometimes get them for just ground pounding a sand dune, but sometimes you have to spend a half hour and a dozen deaths swearing at your TV in order to obtain these glittery lunar prizes.\\nThe motion controls are really annoying. I know lots of people have said it, but it needs to be mentioned. The game is mostly playable without getting too crazy with your motion controls, but more than a few times, I've found myself losing HP or even dying because I couldn't get Cappy to do what I wanted. There are very few ways in which they enhance gameplay, like shaking the controller upside down to climb faster...but that really just feels unnecessary. There are a lot of people who swear by the motion controls on other games like Splatoon 2, and I accept that. Just offer gameplay that is equally as robust without them. There are puzzles and secret areas that are essentially impossible without motion controls so the game's statement that motion controls aren't necessary is false.\\nAnother gripe that I have is that there is an endless amount of new costumes and combinations to play with, but they are essentially just skins. All costumes do the same thing and do not affect game play in any way that I've seen so far. That's somewhat disappointing, and I think it's a missed opportunity to add some more depth to the gameplay.\\n\\nOverall, I think the game is really solid, but not perfect. It has some of the innovative gameplay of Mario 64, some of the charm of Paper Mario, and a bit of a twist in the mechanics like Sunshine, but honestly, it doesn't do any of those things quite as well which is why I gave it 4 stars. Anybody rating the game lower than a 3 is probably a troll. Despite its shortcomings, it's still a really great solid game that will give you lots of hours of exciting gameplay.\\n\\nEdit: having completed the game (current moon total 505), I can say this game is really a triumph for Mario. Nothing has changed from what I wrote above but some of the post game and final worlds really sold me. The game gets beautifully nostalgic at the end. You won't regret buying it.\", '8': 'Super Mario Odyssey is a game that someone can play for hours on end without even feeling like time has passed, so many scenes will give you child-like flashbacks, remembering older games like 64 and galaxy, while still being completely original. While playing, no matter what age you will feel like a child playing this game, from its excellent narration to its stellar gameplay.

Tested on Logitech G240 Gaming Mouse Pad \", 'Product Reviews': {'1': \"1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.\\n\\n2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.\\n\\n3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.\\n\\n4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.\\n\\n5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.\\n\\n6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.\\n\\nOverall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless. The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech.\", '2': \"I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.\\n\\nThe build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.\\n\\nLogitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down.\", '3': \"I have been using this mouse for almost two weeks and am very glad I made the purchase. My previous mouse was the Logitec G502 Hero, which is also a phenomenal mouse. The G502 Hero is a much cheaper alternative, but it is wired. The G502 Lightspeed has the same great sensor, but it has a few more buttons and is just a little heavier.\\n\\nThat being said, there was a small break-in period for me while using the mouse. For the first few days, it felt too uncontrollable. You'd be surprised how much of an impact a wire will cause on your mouse's feel. The drag of the wire being gone was alone a big thing to get used to. This mouse is also lighter which added to the feeling. After a week of daily usage, it feels MUCH better, even better than my last mouse.\\n\\nThis mouse also has fewer buttons than the G502, but sometimes less is more! It has the primary buttons you need for FPS games.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Easy setup. Just install Logitech G Hub for customization.\\n- Great battery life with very quick charging.\\n- Great for large hands using claw grip.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Price\\n- Fewer buttons than G502 but you won't miss them after the break-in period\\n- Small break-in period if moving from heavier mice.\\n\\nOverall solid mouse. 10/10 overall, but only getting a 4 star in the Ergonomic category since the stock pads are not as good as aftermarket alternatives, but they are still very usable.\", '4': '*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I\\'m incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.\\n\\nThat is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \"break-in\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.\\n\\nIt\\'s how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \"tell\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn\\'t feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you\\'re breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.\\n\\n----Old Review----\\n\\nI honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I\\'m a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I\\'m very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \"hand feel\" of the mouse. If they don\\'t make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.\\n\\nThe problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.\\n\\nNow, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don\\'t care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn\\'t care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you\\'re trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.\\n\\nHowever, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar\\'s hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits? I\\'m far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there\\'s no strange \"glide\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can\\'t emphasize this enough, the fact I can\\'t tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.\\n\\nI have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn\\'t even want to consider going back. That\\'s how good it felt to use this thing.\\n\\nI\\'m going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don\\'t have another one with this issue. If I don\\'t have any further issues, I will update this review.', '5': \"As a dedicated gamer who seeks precision and performance, the Logitech G Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse has proven to be an extraordinary addition to my gaming arsenal.

If you're looking to take your gaming experience to the next level and gain a competitive edge, the Logitech G Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is a must-have addition to your gaming setup.\", '6': 'So lets get this out of the way, why not 5 stars. The only reason I\\'m not giving this mouse 5 stars is because the profile/settings are not stored on the hardware itself. Logitech software must be running for RGB profile as well as resolution setting. The mouse has a default RGB setting and DPI. This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe that is the reason? My previous wired mice Razer and Corsair brand seemed to keep their profile.\\n\\nCharging:\\n\\nI don\\'t have the charging mat to go with this mouse, but I don\\'t find it a hassle to charge. Pretty convenient using the cable they provide which the USB dongle can attach to. I try to swap them out once a week just to make sure it always has a charge.\\n\\nHand-feel:\\n\\nI have fairly large hands (6\\'2\" is my height), the size was a little concerning for me as I\\'ve always purchased large mice. I like it though, it weighs next to nothing, especially compared to the last few mice I\\'ve used. The only other minor gripe I have with this mouse is that I tend to have my pinky on the ground when I play. There are times when I flick right (I\\'m right handed) and the fat on my pinky goes under the mouse bringing up the right edge of the mouse off the table. The mouse basically must have full contact to operate and I have noticed at times, not just flicking, but panic tracking, that the mouse is non-responsive because it is just a few MMs off the table. I\\'ve been trying to adjust how I hold the mouse which always alleviates the issue, and I could probably benefit from better mouse-posture anyway, so I can\\'t really consider this in my star-rating.\\n\\nSoftware:\\n\\nIMO Razer has the absolute best software for my needs. The Logitech software seems good, I\\'ll need more time and play more variety of games to really see if it checks all the boxes for me though. I\\'ve been fairly casual since I got this mouse, Ark Survival Evolved, Rust, Icarus, Among Us, pretty much all things that only require default functionality, no MMO play yet.\\n\\nRandom thoughts:\\n\\nWhat happened to the day when we\\'d add weights to our mice? I think part of it is the popularity of quick-action shooters such as Valorant. You can\\'t flick with a boulder. I purchased this mouse because I really like the game Rust, a popular Rust streamer, spoonkid, plugged this mouse during one of his streams and I wanted to check it out. I tell you what, I went from a rock on the beach to AK in half the time with this mouse. j/k I still suck at Rust, but that\\'s on me.', '7': 'Let me start off by saying that this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC! I have been using it for nearly a week now and have already fallen in love. Before this mouse, I used a Hyperx pulsefire haste, which is around 60 grams and is pretty good, but It started acting up only after a year of ownership. This mouse weights about 20 grams more but doesn\\'t feel like it, the weight is balanced so well that it feels like an ultra-lightweight mouse, and the battery life is incredible especially if you turn off the RGB (you can do this in the Logitech G Hub software). I\\'m predicting around 7-10 days of use, using it around 8 hours a day. The build quality is pretty good and the mouse is extremely comfortable, the scroll wheel is tactile while also not feeling \"crunchy\" and the buttons all feel top tier. The tracking is also exceptional and I have not experienced any issues with the sensor. There are 5 DPI settings by default, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 which can be swapped by using the button on the bottom of the mouse. You can make your own profile in the Logitech G Hbu software and set your DPI anywhere between 100 and 25600. You can also change the polling rate in this software, the 4 options are 1000, 500, 250, and 125 hz. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is in the market for an extremely comfortable, well-balanced, and reliable mouse.', '8': \"Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.\\n\\n*Packaging*\\n\\nFor a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.\\n\\n*Opening*\\n\\nSo once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.\\n\\n*Package Contents*\\n\\nThe package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.\\n\\n*The Mouse*\\n\\nThe mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.\\n\\n*Installation*\\n\\nSo the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.\\n\\n*The feels*\\n\\nSo I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.\\n\\n*Tracking*\\n\\nSo this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.\\n\\n*Conclusion*\\n\\nI was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.\", '9': \"So I have small hands, and I came from the wired Razer Viper Mini because I wanted to go wireless to get rid of the cable drag sensation. The G Pro compared to the Viper Mini is heavier and bigger, so it was hard to handle initially, but I eventually got used to it. If you have bigger hands or are used to using bigger mice, this will be great for you - you won't have to go through an adjustment period. I think for my next upgrade I'll go for the G Pro X Superlight. I'm a lower sens FPS player so the lighter the better, but I'd still recommend the G Pro for competitive FPS gaming if you want a higher end gaming mouse, but don't wanna break the bank too much.\", '10': \"I recently purchased a mouse with high hopes for a seamless computing experience, but unfortunately, it has a notable flaw—periodic disconnections. The mouse itself is comfortable to use, with a sleek design and responsive buttons, but the intermittent disconnects proved to be a significant inconvenience during work and gaming sessions.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the customer support team was exceptionally helpful and responsive when I reached out about the issue. They promptly acknowledged the problem, guided me through troubleshooting steps, and eventually facilitated a replacement. Their efficiency and commitment to resolving the issue left a positive impression.\\n\\nWhile the periodic disconnections were a frustration, the positive customer support experience salvaged my overall satisfaction with the product. If the connectivity issue is addressed in future versions, this mouse could be a top contender in the market. For now, it's a decent choice with the caveat of occasional disruptions, mitigated by the reliable support team's efforts to make things right.\"}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'rand_index', '_id': 'zOfBc40B-Q_i0rt4NUwW', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - US Version', 'Product Price': '45', 'Product Rating': '4.8', 'Product Number of Rates': '52,009 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/81KGsbq8ekL._SY445_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Discover Hyrule as never before: by making your own path, choices, and consequences Ingenuity is the key to survival: find multiple solutions to tons of dynamic puzzles Surprises hide around every corner: scavenge weapons, armor, plants, animals, and more Live off the land: find weapons and armor, cook food, and brew elixirs Utilize special technology: the in-game Sheikah Slate controls, objects and enemies in fun ways ', 'Product Reviews': {'1': '**No spoiler review**\\n\\nAt this point, I could never have imagined the game industry without this game. Every once in a while, a game comes out that just says what everyone is thinking subconsciously but cannot quite make out the words, an itch that needs to be scratched, that puts all the pieces together in entertainment culture and builds the foundation for the next age for the game industry. This is that game.\\n\\nGameplay: The limits have been lifted. There are almost no restrictions to the possibilities of engagement with the environmental situations. Remember how amazing the Metroid screw jump felt in Metroid Prime 2, flying for the first time in Mario 64, jumping through the web in the Deku tree in Ocarina of Time, etc. In those moments, you knew you had experienced something that would change you, that you were playing a game that reached far beyond what you thought was possible. Now imagine a game that applies that feeling to every element of the game. While diverging some from past Zelda mechanics, they are changes that encourage you to grow as a player and engage in your environment and as such could not have been any other way. Don\\'t worry, it is very nicely balanced.\\n\\nMusic: Even the music approach has been redefined for this game. Eerie, peaceful, and epic. I do not think a single note in this game is synthesized and the sensation feels like the game is calling to you or empathizing with you. The music element is used in a way that is unlike anything you probably have experienced before, hearkening back to the complex music development in intellectual music of the 20th century. The best visual reference I can give is that the music feels like water hitting your skin, that is how tangible it is.\\n\\nGraphics: When a design is this polished and revolutionary, graphics, while normally being the easiest to pinpoint, easily take more of a backseat, however this game has some of the most psychologically stimulating environments of any game in recent years. Graphics for this game cannot be discussed separate from gameplay as everything flows together in a near perfect fashion. The physics used in conjunctions with the models and layout of the map are immediately accessible and complex. Here are some examples of scope: The scope of the land is so vast and varied that every minute exploring provides an almost entirely different experience than the one just prior. A friend of mine is playing the game and while we have both been exploring the same areas, neither of us over the course of three days came across the exact same elements in the exact same way other than a town that the story led us both to. *In the overview of the world as seen in the picture on the box cover, every viewable (and not viewable) crevice is an entirely different world of exploration that is both gorgeous and fully interactive.\\n\\nDesign: Arguably the best quality of Breath of the Wild is how the elements come together. The expanse and themes, while Zelda, feel like they were taken out of the imagination of the renaissance 80s, a characteristic usually only touched on by unique cult-classic romps but here is fully realized in an immersive experience. The characters have such a unique and retro feel that they are both unsettling and comforting in the same breath. From the music to the landscape to the vocals and setting, this game truly brings together all the design elements in a masterful way.\\n\\nCONS: (nit-picking; do not read this section) Amidst all of these amazing elements, there are a few potential improvements that could be made.\\n1) There are not voice-overs for all NPC dialog. This was a similar complaint that I had with the last 2 home console Zelda titles. If the production values on the game are high enough to immerse you as this title has done, all NPC lines should be voiced rather than only a few.\\n2) The obvious cloud shadows during high sun are so realistic that it makes you look up, however the clouds in the sky do not coincide with the shadows. Often I would expect to see a close cloud or a storm front coming in, and not have either.\\n3) Some powers suffer from quirky control mapping.\\n4) Simple textures and meshes often are crude for the sake of object and environment scope. Forgiveable, but noticeable.\\n5) The interactive detail in the game is so high that it is noticeable when Link\\'s hands don\\'t lineup with climbing elements or when objects quickly \"transition\" into items *cough* tree trunks *cough*\\n6) Greatly miss the presence of at least a few major in-ground elements or dungeons. Most of the world is the same \"trial\" format with huge surface landscapes.\\n7) More purpose, depth, and variety in the lives of the NPC characters that inhabit Hyrule. (As far as engine planning, this element could require as much preparation as the development of the world itself.)\\n8) Inability to change the view if needed. (When in a tree, avoiding being seen or fire from horseback bokoblins, the leaves and branches become too much of a visual obstruction from accurately shooting arrows or observing.\\n*All of these will likely improve or appear in future Zelda games overtime. Again, this game is the dawn of a new age and standard in game design.\\n\\nI have not been as satisfied and amazed with a game as I am with Breath of the Wild since Nintendo 64. This game has the same feeling as the first arrival of Ocarina of Time, Mario 64, Link to the Past, Final Fantasy 7, Super Mario Brothers, and Super Mario World. Up until now, nothing had dethroned Majora\\'s Mask, Metroid Prime, and Ocarina of Time as my best, new favorite experiences, despite having played the large expanse and epic battles of Shadows of the Colossus, the emotional play of Resident Evil 4, the new learning approach and vicarious interactions of The Last Guardian, and nearly every other major release from Bethesda, Naughty Dog, and more. This game has surpassed all of my prior memories and claimed its rightful place as the game that defines gaming. I never thought I would feel that level of amazement again in the industry, but it is here and it isn\\'t even VR. Game design at it\\'s finest and why Nintendo still remains the definitive development standard.', '2': 'Wow, who would have thought that after thirty incredible years of Zelda, with some of the best and most critically acclaimed games ever, Nintendo would manage to create what is, hands down, the best Zelda game to date in the form of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, it is time to step aside. The Zelda series has a new champion. Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and feels destined to be a classic.\\n\\nThe Legend of Zelda series is, I must admit, my favorite video game series of all time (which is my favorite past-time) I have been absolutely obsessed with Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time at the age of ten, sometimes obsessed to a rather unhealthy degree. I have loved every Zelda game, and especially every 3D Zelda, though none of them quite captured the same feeling of wonder and exploration. Until very recently, I would rank Ocarina of Time as my favorite video game of all time, but it looks as though that mantle is finally being passed to another game. Breath of the Wild feels like the Zelda game Nintendo has always wanted to make, but hasn’t been able to do to technological constraints or what have you. This game feels like the essence of what Zelda is, and always has been, about. While this is a lengthy review, this is a game that warrants such a lengthy review.\\n\\nStory: The story to this game begins in a place called the chamber of resurrection. Our hero, Link, has been asleep in a form of stasis for 100 years. When he awakes, he finds the land of Hyrule in ruins, starting with the desolate Temple of Time on the Great Plateau, the starting location. Link is told by a voice in his head that he must be the light to shine upon the land of Hyrule. After meeting a mysterious old man (throwback to the original Zelda game there) Link sets out on his quest to save Hyrule from the evil monster inside Hyrule Castle, known as the Calamity Ganon. Without spoiling too much of this story, I will only say that it is probably the most cinematic Zelda story to date. The fact that this game has voice acting, which is a first for the Zelda series, adds a lot of weight to the key story moments. The characters feel far more fleshed out, and they feel genuinely human. This game’s version of the titular princess Zelda might be the most relatable and interesting incarnation of the character to date, as she has genuine depth to her character. The other pivotal characters also feel uniquely more fleshed out as well, providing some of the most memorable story cut-scenes in a Zelda game, or any Nintendo game. Though Wind Waker and Skyward Sword might rival it, this is probably the best Zelda story to date. It does a great job of immersing you into the Gameplay and the world itself. Moreover, as you explore the world, you feel as though a story is being told through the exploration itself. One of the ingenious methods to the story-telling in this game is how it is told in a nonlinear nature, meaning that you can track down different pieces of the story in any order, and still have it all make sense in the end. Parts of the story are also optional, so it doesn’t ever feel like it’s spoon-fed to you, which is a good thing.\\n\\nPresentation: Right off the bat, I must say that Breath of the Wild is one of the most Gorgeous looking games that has ever been made to me. The simple, soft and vibrant colors also contain a hidden elegance and sophistication that can convey lots of emotion both in terms of story and Gameplay. The style feels reminiscent of Skyward Sword’s, which I also adored, but taken to the next level. This is the first Zelda title to be made in HD, and it shows. The character designs are flawless, and unforgettable. The stunning lighting effect, particularly when the sun rises and sets, remain beautiful to watch from start to finish, and the whole game just looks fantastic. This is magnified on the Nintendo Switch, with longer draw distances and a better performance overall than the Wii U version. There were still some frame-rate drops during moments in the game, particularly during battle moments against the Moblin enemies. While the frame-rate hiccups are still noticeable on the Switch, the game runs noticeably better overall. This minor complaint never ruined the game, or the immersion for me.\\n\\nI for one love the choice of music in this game. The subtle but brilliant use of piano cords make the world feel more natural and organic, and is contrasted brilliantly with the high-energy guardian themes and shrine theme. This, in a way, helps the thematic element of nature versus technology play out in its sound design. While the music may not be something you would listen to outside of the game in the same way you would with previous Zelda games, I believe the music and sound design is perfect for this game. That said, the horse riding theme, Hateno village, and Hyrule Castle are amazing pieces. The Hateno Village theme is simple and beautiful. The voice acting is also very solid, and I would love to see future Zelda games expand on it even more.\\n\\nWhat it comes down to is that the visual style choices, and the music help to make this, arguably, the most immersive and atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, and it serves the gameplay perfectly.\\n\\nGameplay: This is the best and most top-notch Gameplay I have ever experienced, period. The controls are so darn good that you could bounce a dime of them and get change leftover. As a veteran Zelda player, there was a learning curve to the controls at first, but after getting accustomed to them, they really did feel like second nature. This is the first 3D Zelda to have a jump button, a simple addition that changes the Gameplay mechanics significantly. Furthermore, the ability to climb in this game also adds a whole new dimension to the Gameplay.\\n\\nThis time around, the enemy AI is quite advanced for a Zelda title. The enemies also do quite a bit more damage to Link than they ever have before in a 3D title. What this means is that every encounter, and combat situation feels dangerous, and as though something is at stake. Link’s arsenal of weapons this time around includes far more than just a single sword, but many swords, as well as sticks, axes, spears, clubs, magic rods, and more. You also have a plethora of shields to use, and bows to use. The weapons in this game do break after being used a bit, which might be a point of contention to some. I love this mechanic, and feel that it forces you as the player to think and be strategic as to how you approach every encounter with an enemy. Link can also use stealth to sneak up on his enemies, destroy exploding barrels nearby and watch the enemies scream in horror (such as satisfying feeling,) or even use his rune abilities to take the enemies out before they know what hit them (more on that later.) The possibilities in this game feel almost endless. The coolest move Link can pull off in this game is the flurry rush; when fighting an enemy close-up, if you dodge just in time, Link will do a dodge or backflip in slow-motion, and proceed by striking the enemy several times, ending them in the process. It’s the coolest thing ever.\\n\\nIn this game, Link uses a plethora of abilities known as the Rune abilities. With these abilities, Link can create remote bombs that he can explode upon impact whenever desired. You can also use Cryonis, which creates ice blocks from water, which can be used as platforms to climb. You can use what is called stasis, which temporarily freezes objects in place, allowing you to hit them several times, after which point they go flying every which way. Then there is Magnesis, which is my favorite. This allows Link to push, pull, and lift heavy metal objects from afar, and use them to make paths, or even drop them on enemies from a distance. You’ll often stumble upon scenarios, particularly in the dungeons and shrines, that allow you to find your own clever ways of solving puzzles with these brilliant and fun mechanics. Like every aspect of the game, the experimentation alone will soak up hours of your life.\\n\\nSpeaking of shrines and dungeons, the dungeons in this game are vastly different than in previous Zelda games. Whereas previous Zelda’s had you collect keys, a key item, in order to make it to the final boss fight, this game’s dungeons are more based around experimentation and manipulation. Through using Link’s powers and abilities, as well as the map in this game, it allows Link to manipulate the layout of the dungeon, and essentially bend them to his will. This is another aspect of this Zelda that feels so fresh and fun. The bosses at the end of the dungeon are also really fun to fight. While the game only has four main dungeons, there are more than 100 mini shrines throughout. The shrines are essentially bite-sized dungeons, and play-out as such on a micro level. Many of them require you to use your rune abilities to solve them and progress, while others have you engage in a little boss fight of sorts with a guardian robot. Needless to say, these shrines are fantastic and provide some of the most enjoyable and mind-bending scenarios I’ve ever encountered, and manage to surprise at every turn. Moreover, the whole over-world almost feels like one giant, outdoor dungeon. What I mean by that is that while it isn’t literally a huge dungeon, you begin solving puzzles and thinking about where, and how you want to proceed to the next shrine or dungeon right of the bat. Simply getting to these shrines and dungeons feels like a puzzle in and of itself.\\n\\nBeing a truly open-world game, this game’s real obstacle, beyond even the enemies and the dungeons, is the world itself. This game is an open world adventure game, but it’s also a survival one. This world feels alive. The weather changes, the wild-life has a mind of its own, and the world will try to kill you in a multitude of ways. Whether it be by falling from foolishly attempting to climb massive heights, to lightning striking your metal items, to the wild animals such as bears and wolves that see you as their next meal. Furthermore, the realistic and ingenious physics engine makes the game world feel more natural.\\n\\nThe trick then, is to use the world to your advantage. By hunting wild animals and gathering supplies and ingredients, Link can cook a multitude of dishes and elixirs to refill both his heart meter (no hearts in pots or grass in this game) or his stamina gauge. You can hunt just about any wild animal you see in the wild. Cooked meat is always more effective than raw meat in straightening you, and you can combine it with other ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or grains and wheat to increase their effect. You can make potions by combining critters such as lizards, frogs, or bugs with monster parts that provide different temporary stat boosts. Just look out for the dubious food! You can also break chunks of rocks to find minerals, ore, and other materials. By buying and selling these goods, you create your own in game economy of sorts.\\n\\nThe other aspect of this game that makes it truly feel like the “open air” experience that Eji Aonuma called it is none other than the glorious climbing mechanic. You can climb almost anything in this game, whether it be a rock face, a cliff, buildings, towers, Hyrule Castle itself, the Temple of Time, you name it. You can even climb trees, and certain rock monsters that appear throughout the world. Climbing is yet another big component and aspect to this game that Nintendo really got down pat, and it does feel like a game changer. I’ve played several games where you can climb certain things, like Assassin’s Creed or Uncharted, but never has it been this freeing in how you can do it. This simple yet elegant mechanic really makes the already huge world feel even bigger. Climbing will slowly eat up your stamina gauge, so it’s up to you to figure out how you want to approach it, and finding little footholds is always a good way to rest when you need to. The only places you can’t climb every wall is in the dungeons and the shrines. The other open-air aspect to this world is the paraglider. When you reach the top of the mountain or a tower, you don’t need to worry about climbing all the way back down. Now, Link can simply jump off the cliff, and glide down to the world below ala Batman. This mechanic remains euphoric from start to finish. It is also an ingenious way to fix what could have been a potential problem before it happened, by allowing you to breezily get down a mountain pf tower right off the bat without having to climb all the way back down.\\n\\nIn this game, you can catch any number of wild horses, tame them, and check them into a stable. In past Zelda’s, your horse was Epona, and it was the only horse you could get. Here, there are several horses, some are harder to get than others, and they all have different stats. When you do catch your horse, it really does feel like your own horse, since you caught it, tamed it, and gave it a name. You can hold up to five horses at any given time, and ride around the world, into the villages, and even approach combat while on horseback with your melee weapons and bows. As someone who finds joy and excitement by simply exploring the game world, and doing random things, riding around Hyrule has never felt more fun. I used to love doing that all the way back in Twilight Princess, and this aspect puts that game to shame. The Horses can die, which may seem annoying to some, but I love it as, once again, it offers more strategy and thinking than previous games. When fighting a Guardian, it’s better going up against it on horseback as you have the element of speed on your side.\\n\\nUnlike previous Zelda games, where boss battles were restricted to the dungeons themselves, here in Breath of the Wild, you will often encounter boss like enemies in the world. These come in the form of giant rock monsters (Stone Talus,) Centaur-like creatures (Lynels, another throwback to Zelda on NES,) and the now iconic game enemy known as the Guardian’s (octopus-like robots that attempt to kill you throughout the game.) You can approach these enemies however you choose, or not approach them at all and leave them be at first. Throughout the game, as you become more powerful, you may be bold enough to take them on, it is all up to you. The first time I killed a Guardian was a defining moment for me, as was my first Lynel kill. What’s amazing is that even after you have several of the key upgrades, the enemies still feel like a threat.\\n\\nWhat makes the Gameplay in Breath of the Wild so good, and so perfect, is that you as the player can literally approach it however you want. The whole world is your oyster, and it’s up to you to figure out how you want to use it.\\n\\nReplay value. This game has lots of reason to play even after your first initial playthrough, which will likely take at least forty hours if you just do the main story. I have played this game from start to finish a few times already (and probably will several more times.) As it stands, you can find all of the optional things in the game (the Master Sword itself is optional,) Find and beat all of the shrines, collect all of the Korok seeds (plant like creature fans may know from Wind Waker,) and do any number of side-quests. The side-quests I have done have all been tremendously fun, and while the rewards may be simple, just playing them feels like a reward. You can help herd cucoos for a chicken-freak in Kakariko village, catch a royal white-steed, help a man start a village from the ground-up, and even build your own house in Hateno Village. This game has tons of replay value, apart from just the urge to go back and play it again. Because of the open-ended nonlinear nature of this game, you can replay the game from start to finish, and take a completely different path, even so far as taking on the last boss right away (though not a good idea if you value your life.) Just experimenting with all the different weapons, finding all the different locations and using your rune abilities will keep you distracted for quite some time.\\n\\n**Nintendo Switch differences:\\nHaving played this game on the Switch as well as the Wii U, I can safely say that either version will deliver an incredible experience. That said, the Switch version is probably ever so slightly the superior version. Apart from running a little bit better, I found the switch controller very comfortable, particularly with how easy it is the detach the joy-cons from the controller slots to the tablet-screen. Speaking of which, playing this game on the go is a lot of fun. I would recommend saving the key story moments for the TV, but playing the game casually undocked with the Switch screen has felt great. **\\n\\nVerdict:\\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and a game I feel will be looked at as a timeless classic. While it isn’t literally “perfect,” it has its occasional frame-rate issues, and the very occasional camera issue, it is, to me, as close to flawless as video game’s get. I haven’t been this immersed, this addicted, or simply had this much fun with a single player game in years, if not decades. This is the best game Nintendo has made in likely the past twenty years, if not ever. I have no regrets in saying I am ready to move on from Ocarina of Time being my all-time favorite video game, as Breath of the Wild now takes the cake. This is the game that really feels tailored to be played however you choose. It feels like the fully realized Zelda game that Nintendo has always wanted to make, and the one we as fans have been salivating for. A new Zelda of any kind is always a big deal, but this one feels uniquely special. I hyped this game to Death Mountain and back, and not only does it meet expectations, it defies them. This feels like a giant playground full of joy, wonder, discovery exploration, and fun. This is a game of survival, action, adventure, comedy, sadness, joy, and excitement, all wrapped into one package. To say it bluntly, this has everything that makes Gaming such a great past-time to me, and millions of people, and it manages to capture the essence of Zelda most of all. This is an absolute must-buy, and a must play. I would honestly encourage you to get a Wii U, or a Nintendo Switch if you do not already have one, to experience this Masterpiece. So get it, play it, enjoy it, and take a Breath of the magnificent Wild.\\n\\nCons:\\nOccasional frame-rate issues\\nPros:\\nSublime Controls\\nPerfect, Flawless, and incredible Gameplay\\nMasterful Open-World Exploration\\nFreedom and personal choice\\nMechanics encourage experimentation\\nFresh new dungeon design\\nAmazing art direction\\nBrilliant music and sound design\\nGreat Voice Acting\\nGreat Story and awesome characters\\nLots of secrets to find\\nLots of replay value\\nOverall: 10/10\\nPeace, Dana', '3': \"I want to start off by saying that this is the first Amazon Review I've ever written, so I hope it's of some use to at least one individual that stumbles upon it.\\n\\nBefore I go into praising BotW I'd like to mention that there are frequent frame rate dips when playing the game on the Switch while docked. In handheld mode, this problem is all but nonexistent. Yes, there are times where it is noticeably annoying, but I would not go as far as to say that you shouldn't purchase this incredible game because of this issue.\\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch is a marvel to behold.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nThe LoZ plays smoothly and responsively. When I first wrapped my fingers around the joy-cons and played this game, I felt like the placement of some of the commands felt a little out of place. Aside from the placement of the jump button (which can be changed) that forces you to claw the controller in order to run and jump, you end up getting used to the button layout. Unfortunately, there are a few connectivity issues with the joy-cons that Nintendo needs to improve upon, but if you're playing with a Pro Controller (highly recommended) than you won't need to worry about that. There are so many unique ways to combine food and other items in order to come up with creative dishes and elixirs to aid you during your journey. The combat is what you'd expect from a Zelda game, but with the inclusion of weapon durability and variety, no encounter is similar to the next. Also, Link can now scale almost anything due to a new climbing mechanic. It is the best feeling to climb up large mountains and look down at the gorgeous world that Nintendo has created for us. Sometimes you will reach the top of something just before running out of stamina, and I can honestly say that moments like these are what make the game feel so special.\\n\\nDifficulty:\\nI wanted to touch on this a little bit because I for one don't consider many of the Zelda games to be especially difficult in terms of combat encounters, but this new entry changes that. If you're fighting multiple enemies at once, be prepared with a strategy beforehand or else get your butt handed to you. Enemies down the line will give you a hard time for sure.\\n\\nEnvironment:\\nBreath of the Wild is a gorgeous game and saying that still doesn't do it justice. The art style fits perfectly with the series. The world is beautiful, vibrant, and very much alive. There will be moments where you'll just stop and enjoy the sunset just because of how much the weather impacts you throughout the game. After an entire night trying to climb cliffs in the rain, the sun rising and sky clearing is a brief moment of reprieve. The wildlife and assortment of plant life is extremely expansive in terms of diversity and uniqueness. There is just so much to look at. Not to mention, the map itself is HUGE! I've clocked almost 30 hours into the game and there are still many areas i have yet to explore. It's exciting to think about!\\n\\nStory and Characters:\\nIt's a Zelda game so you probably already know what to expect, but I think Nintendo has upped the game in this regard even still. The characters are each likable in their own way, and the relationships they have with each other make you enjoy the game even further. I don't want to go into too much detail about that for fear of spoilers but just know that the events of this story impact the characters in ways that give you an inviting insight into their emotions.\\n\\nMusic and Voice Acting:\\nThe music is miraculous. Most of the time throughout your journey the only thing you will hear is the sounds... of nature. Birds chirping, deer running, horses galloping, rain falling, and lightning cracking. It's amazing! Of course when you enter a town or other occupied area, that's when the BotW soundtrack truly shines.\\nThis is the first time a Zelda game has included voice acting, and I'm here to tell you that you won't be disappointed. You will be very judgmental of the vocal performances at first, but that's only because it's SO WEIRD hearing real voices come from the characters that you've grown to know and love over the years. Once you get over that initial surprise you will begin to appreciate the performances, which I believe to be very well done. I absolutely love Zelda's voice actress. I was never a huge fan of the character myself, but I've adopted a whole new appreciation of the character by the way she's portrayed in this game.\\n\\nTo wrap things up, I'd like to say that this game might be one of the few games ever created that is a MUST PLAY for anyone that's a fan of video games. It's just a fun, beautiful, memorable, and unique experience that anyone watching/playing can admire.\\nI've played many incredible video games in my lifetime, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the only one that forced me to write an Amazon Review.\\n\\nI'm absolutely positive that you will be 'blown away' by The Breath of the Wild ;)\", '4': 'This is just a fight game I recieved a Used game that was missing it\\'s pamphlet the used order was cancelled that this changed to new condition without approval we would have possibly just cancelled. It is nothing like Zelda Ocarina that was a group of small mini games all sewn together in a fairly great fable. At first I was very hesitant to buy this game because a serious gamer said he beat it in 30 hours and we had a few years of fun playing Zelda Ocarina of Time all it\\'s side games and mini games while using it to teach the children to read instructions. They became great fans of Zelda and when they got older asked for a Wii they specifically asked for the game and bow set up for I guess the name was Link for their birthdays as they both are born in March. I have not played this Link line of games since Nintendo 64 and as I play through it not using walk throughs as I was told it is a short game I am learning this young man must have skipped all the side actitivies, competitions and looking for all the game gifts just fought his way through the game.\\nI think if the information that comes with the new game helps play the game it would have been worth purchasing a new game or at least a book to help me find things. I do not know if there is a map to discover in the game like in Ocarina but I am very lost and tracking backwards without a good map in this game. I hope it turns up somewhere or I can buy it as I just bought salt for the recipes. The recipes are fun it would be nice if I could keep a list of what was done so I can make the better ones again as I discover them in game play. I find the mountains very difficult to climb without the speed and stamina elixers.\\nIt is growing on my slowly.\\nThis is not a child\\'s game like Zelda Ocarina of time with brighter colors that would probably be excellent updated for the Switch for younger children...but it is an adventure game. At first because it is a big jump from the 64 game I did not like it but as time went on it began to grow on me I am beginning to like it but I sure would like a map I am so lost even driving without a physical recent map.\\nDo you want a nice review or do you want the truth\\nThe graphics apparently are very good on Zelda Breath of time for the Switch.\\nBut like with Skylanders Imaginators which runs on Toys to Life which I began playing because my nephew plays it on my Switch gifted to me for Christmas.\\n\\nI found the new Switch Zelda game to be very difficult loaded constantly with Boss monsters and difficult puzzles.\\nThese is only normal run and Pro run games so it is apparently designed for the hard core gamer unlike the Zelda Ocarina of time I bought used for near new price many years after it as designed for the Nintendo 64 because it was more a younger persons puzzle and adventure game loaded with mini games and not as much violence.\\n\\nThis is a Hard core games game apparently someone who just finds a way to fight to the end then resells or soon after purchasing it like I bought it used missing all the pamphlets and information and then it was tried to be foisted off on me as a new game.\\n\\nIf it had been new I would have returned it because I am a beginnger level player always will be even though I have playe 20 years.\\nI use walk throughs and information to help me play most games.\\n\\nBut as this is a constant fight fight fight M for Mature Violent game now if you are a hard core gamer you can rent the game fight through ignore all the side quests, not enjoy the horses which are very untameable and do not follow good directions so much I often found myself walking and whistling for the away horse.\\n\\nIf you like near impossible puzzles and fighting very few clues in a game that does not like to let you go back where you have been and just want to fight through a game this is the game for you.\\nBut rent it and play it on the Switch handheld counsel as it looks very washed out on the tv.\\n\\nDesigned for the Switch and for the Hardcore gamers\\n\\nNot a child\\'s game.\\nBut if you are a hard core gamer I suggest you get the Ammibos to up the gameplay a bit which they do not tell you can be used in the game and run it on professional level before you try to resell it.\\nAlso the harder part of the game than the monsters are some of the many Shrine puzzles one which runs like a marble roll game there is a trick I am working out on how to solve it.\\n\\nIf it was for a child or a novice player and less about fighting and adventure I am sure it would be kept by the right people driving up the pice like Animal Crossing has.\\n\\nIf you want a review that you do not pay for\\ndon\\'t punish the honest person for saying I don\\'t like it\\nBut the hard core gamers love it.\\nSo I knew when someone told me they beat it in 30 hours it as probably just a bang bang fight fight hit hit hard core gamers game.\\n\\nI rate it M for Mature and Lots of Game violence as the bully monsters constnatly beat up travelers whom you can save to come back and find them stuck eternally in the same scenario with the same monsters for the same small monster organ rewards for killing them and saving the victims.\\n\\nI found most the recipets to be near worthless against Boss Monsters which this game is loaded with.\\n\\nI give it a big thumbs up for young hard core fight gamers but for novice and children along with parents I suggest you find a game that is less violent as apparently children are shooting us after playing this lot of very violent games out now.\\nIf you are a hardcore gamer like the Game store employees are rent the game don\\'t open the package and try to sell it off to me as new after you have used it or here. And remember some of us who are not serious gamers need the pamphlets and all the help we can get because our minds are different than yours we like to stop eat the apple, cook the meals, see the worlds all over Built by Nintendo and buy the Amiibos.\\nI did not want to buy the game at the game store as I knew as hard as the employee tried to sell it to me \"new\" at a reduced price he had played it while off work and then brought it back repackaged it. Don\\'t sell me a game think I don\\'t know it is not new and do not change the name to new condition and then charge me illegally to my credit card for a used game especially when I know it is missing every single pamphlet that it comes with that gives information like you can use an Amiibo in the game.\\nThis game after all these years seems to still be a single player game which having the option for 2 to 4 player adventuring and fighting the huge monsters online or at home would surely be more entertaining.\\nIf I had paid full price I would be disappointed and stuck with a Used game. Rent these games first before buying if you can find a place to rent them. But so far I have put the Switch down sometimes for months like the Xbox One which has not been used in over a year as the PS3 controllers can be run wired not run out of battery power, run on the tv and the cherished but not mass produced PS vita system which still runs high used because of limited production and high popularity for the number produced.\\nAs I understand it is a loved Gamer hard core game I gave it a 5 star\\nbut for me I give it as sit in the corner now for awhile if the horses are not able to be tamed and are programmed to run away from any sigh of trouble or into a big fight to kill you no in between the horses are crazy. So just walk through.\\n\\nIf all you want to do is run to the end not enjoy the fabulous perk hard to tame and catch seriously wild horses that develop personality issues such after encountering Ogres and other monsters rent the game don\\'t try to resell it to me as new as I buy new games also but as these sold out it has been difficult locally to find it not being resold as a new game when it is used also.', '5': \"It's works great. It's a fun game. It has a very big map and everything can be climbed. It's a Zelda RPG with environmental factors in this game. It's funny watching Link get hit by lightning in a storm and when they have him run around in a circle. The kids ignored the marker on the map and went to turn on all the towers, wood spirits, and shrines before going to a ninja village.\", '6': 'I just wanted to update my review for the game. There\\'s no doubt this game deserves a 5 star score. It\\'s bold and Nintendo created a world that\\'s bigger than any game to date. I want to point out that I did beat the game and completed most of the dungeons that are spread out throughout the game. I\\'m sure by now you\\'ve heard all the good and great things about the game, but there should be the negative as well.\\n\\nFirst, I did not like how Nintendo undermined the weapon system. Weapons and shields break too often. How does this effect the game? You\\'re travelling the vast land, yet you feel reluctant to fight the moblins and goblins because you don\\'t know if it will be worth it for your item to break. Even \"unbreakable\" items can wear out and need time to recharge.\\n\\nSecond, if Nintendo wanted to make the travelling worth while combat and fighting should reward you. Sure there are items and chests to gain if you take over a moblin base, but the items are often not worth it. I would see someone trying to make the case that you need to battle enemies to gain their parts to upgrade armor, but once you upgrade, fighting becomes pointless. There\\'s no experience gained or leveling up, so why not just run away most of the time. I have played Horizon Zero Dawn and in my opinion, HZD\\'s battles felt more Zelda-like than Botw. The weapons and items in HZD seemed to have more value than BOTW. Enemies take more strategy to beat in HZD and every weapon had a purpose to defeating an enemy with a weakness to it. I\\'m not saying HZD is a better game or BOTW is a better game mind you. I\\'m not trolling Zelda, I gave it a 5 star score. For those who played both games, you will see what I am talking about with the enjoyment of battles in HZD.\\n\\nThird, bosses have been simplified. You do not need a special item or much strategy to beat the bosses. In past Zelda\\'s the dungeon\\'s secret item would be the weakness to the boss. But in BOTW all you need is a strong weapon and armor to beat bosses. The bosses were not overly creative. Each boss was only marginally different from the previous.\\n\\nWhere are the iconic items? Where is the boomerang, the hookshot,, heavy boots, bug net, fairy bottles, etc, etc. Items were a central theme in all the Zeldas. Why did they take that out? It was one of the biggest surprises or exciting parts of previous games when opening a chest. Putting value into items is something I would like to see reinstated in future games.\\n\\nFourth, the epic field music is gone and replaced by a subtle piano and atmospheric tunes. In all of the previous Zeldas, I would be either humming or whistling tunes from Zelda for days after I had finished. Yes, the game does have one theme that reoccurs when something important happens or when you beat a boss, or when you find a stable, but not a very memorable soundtrack.\\n\\nFifth, many of the side quests do not have much bearing on the actual main story. Sure, some side quests in the game will help you gain helpful items and armor, but it does not change the ending or how NPC will react to you. Since Nintendo wanted to take a page from the western rpg genre, decision making should have been impactful to the outcome of the game. POTENTIAL SPOILER--->From what I know there are two endings to the game and I have gotten both by visiting all the specific areas in the game that\\'s part of a side quest.\\n\\nSixth, does bigger mean better? In the case that there are 120 mini dungeons in the game, they had to make the world bigger to fit them, but in my opinion, making the world so large made things a little tedious. Sure, there is fast travel, but getting to each location seemed a little bit of a chore especially since fighting enemies was not rewarding, and other than finding mini dungeons and moblin bases, there was nothing much to do. I don\\'t consider hunting or gathering foods that much of reason for the large map.\\n\\nIn no way am I bashing Zelda. In fact, I do believe it deserves to be the game of the year. Even with what I consider as flaws, the good outweigh the negative greatly. I just hope Nintendo can take some advice from their fans to improve the next installment.', '7': \"Game of the year!!! Congrats Nintendo!\\n\\nVery beautiful game.\\nI didn't want it to end. After 100 hours I decided to beat Ganon. I completed 112 shrines, collected over 200 korok seeds and completed many quests. I decided to start a new game and it still feels like a new experience. I find myself going straight to my favorite parts of the game and it is still amazing that there is no mandatory order or path to keep going.\\nI feel like over the years everyone has been spoiled with better graphics and gameplay. The most complaints I heard about the game was frame rate/lag issues, especially around multiple monsters or non-playable characters. But that means nothing to me. I experienced it a few times but it did not drop the game rating from 5 stars.\\nI love the scenery. No matter where you are there is always something beautiful to look at. The landscapes are gorgeous and I love the way everything shines when it rains. Catching wild horses is also fun. I swear I have caught over 40 or 50 horses.\\nIt doesn't matter what you get into in the game. There are always tricks to getting more of what you want. Take a picture of whatever you want to find, vegetables, stones, ingredients, tools, weapons, anything really, and your Sheika slate (tablet that Link uses in the game) will help guide you to find more. I'm always looking for precious metals/stones and it is the easiest way to get 10 thousand rupees or more. However much you need or want.\\nThere are so many quests and challenges. Puzzles that require you to find different characters to get hints or answers. Or to help you find a location of something. Everyone has their own likes and opinions, but to me, Breath of the Wild has no frustrating tasks or quests. I have enjoyed every bit of the game. I loved, loved, loved Breath of the Wild.\\n\\nThe first Zelda game I played was on the Gameboy, Oracle of Seasons. I thought it was fun and great. Especially for its time and portability. I did not consider myself a big Zelda fan until Twilight Princess, though. I own the Wii version and the HD version for the Wii U. I think it will always be my favorite. It is hard to beat a game that allows you to turn into a wolf! I was very excited when I found out that you could bring wolf Link into Breath of the Wild and even use Epona. I use both of them all the time. I'm also very excited about the upcoming DLCs and new story to come. UPDATE: They are here! Very good so far! Good back stories.\\n\\nRecently, I have started playing Ocarina of Time on my 3DS. It is hard to get used to the controls, the smaller screen, and lower graphics but I have heard from so many of my friends that it is one of the best Zelda games ever made. It is hard to compare Breath of the Wild to Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword because you do not have all of the freedom to roam around wherever you want. Breath of the Wild IS freedom. Skyward Sword did give you the option to fly anywhere above the clouds and the worlds were very big but it still does not come close to Breath of the Wild. I haven't played Wind Waker, Majora's Mask or other remakes and older entries of the series but I will eventually.\", '8': 'Im thankful for you always getting what I order correct and ALWAYS ON TIME OR EARLY', '9': 'edit: Sorry this turned into a long review. There\\'s actually more I wanted to mention but it\\'s already too long.\\n\\nI really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn\\'t quite get there.\\n\\nI\\'m not really sure how to frame this review. I\\'ll try and make it generic and not have any plot spoilers. I played this game at least once a day for about 6 weeks (march 11th - april 24th). I don\\'t know of a way to see an official our count but guessing I would say between 150 and 250 hours - when I did finally beat it - I did do a lot of optional things though. Also, I only played it almost entirely with the pro controller\" and a little bit with the Switch in portable-console-mode. Never used the detachable wireless controllers as a controller. I usually got around 2 1/2 - 3 hours as a portable by the way.\\n\\nI\\'ll preface this by saying the last zelda i finished was Ocarina, 20 years ago. Haven\\'t really kept up with Nintendo or zelda since then. Maybe some old zeldas through emulation. Still have TP and skyward sword on my \"to do list\".\\n\\nWhat would someone like me associate with a zelda game? A big over world with at least 8 dungeons of varying amounts of difficulty finding them, locked off areas that aren\\'t accessible until certain items are found (like hookshot, the higher strength bracelet and the boomerang) and of course dungeons that include keys, a compass and a map.\\n\\nWell this zelda has a twist and that idea: instead of 8 fairly large dungeons and areas locked away until you get certain items...there\\'s 120 relatively short shrines only four of which are required to complete the game. And there aren\\'t really areas locked away until you get a specific item. Maybe an area is extremely difficult with only 3 hears and no stamina but it\\'s not physically impossible to get there.\\n\\nThis being an \"open world\" game I can\\'t help but compare to other games of that kind, the freshest on my mind being the elder scrolls games. Skyrim for instance had weapon forging, marriages, a whole magical system, an economics system...far and away more complex than and in-depth than this in other words. But that\\'s the way I have always remembered Zelda games: an \"RPG\" but much more \"accessible\" to kids and players who may not want to spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Actually if you were going to make an elder scrolls comparison Oblivion would be the most obvious in comparison (as I recall it had a lot of ...I want to say oblivion gates..that were optional to beat).\\n\\nIn BotW you don\\'t really \"level up\" and there isn\\'t actually an experience system. You finish shrines to get spirit orbs and then you upgrade either stamina (how long you can go before stopping to rest) or hearts (hit points). In other words you don\\'t specialize in different skill sets. You can cook the best meal there is from the word go if you know the recipe and where to get the ingredients. And the same with archery and weapons skills: you don\\'t get better and better at spears if you specialize in them, it\\'s the same from the first moment as it is at the final fight. And I kind of like that.\\n\\nOver the course of my play through I went through several stages:\\n1. starting the game, learning the controls, finding shrines and not towers with sheika slate scope, running from bokoblins...\\n2. blowing myself up with bombs, continually crouching while trying to run away from mini-bosses, seeing that game over screen a lot\\n3. being addicted to seeing what\\'s over the next horizon, what\\'s over there, staying up until 3am on a work night. This is probably the peak of the experience.\\n4. having uncovered the whole map, having to track down those final shrines and finishing the side quests\\n5. The final stage is kind of...frustrating. I didn\\'t want to finish yet but there wasn\\'t much left to do. The main point of side quests is get either money or \"mad loot\". But at some point I had \"four-starred\" my favorite armor and had 26k rupees so that kind of took away the motivation. So it was more \"farming mini bosses\" to get the ingredients and high level weapons I needed.\\n\\nSo I would say you reach \"peak botw\" around 12 hearts with two divine beasts under your belt.\\n\\nWhat are the cons?\\n- As mentioned before, I kept crouching and very inconvenient times. The analog stick that is used for movement/running, when pushed down, makes Link crouch. This frustrated me to know end. I really wish there was a \"disable crouch\" option, even if temporary. Would made things so much easier.\\n- the technology used for the game is kind of...not powerful enough. For instance animals (or lizards) will run away and then simply disappear. For instances and dear will be right in front of me running circles and then just fade away right in front of me. I find this annoying. As is the sand seals and that can\\'t pull me over rocks but can dive into rocks as if they were sand. It just seems like a lack of attention to detail or...maybe just a flaw in the technology. Really takes me out of the immersion.\\n- The music. Or rather lack thereof. There\\'s a appropriate sounds when something is chasing after Link or there\\'s a mini-boss in the area. But a lot of times it\\'s either generic ambient music or no music at all, just wind blow through trees. I realize Nintendo isn\\'t on forefront of technology but if you\\'re really going to leave out music how about some way of importing custom music? Pandora? Something? Probably too much to ask.\\n- Even with the latest patch (as of april 25th 2017) I get some frame rate issues (I played with it on the dock/connected to a TV 99% of the time). Not very often and I don\\'t remember it actually affecting game play. But that doesn\\'t make it any less annoying.\\n- I have the physical version of the game and sometimes those loading times kind of get to me. Feels like I\\'m in the early 90s waiting for my 1x CD ROM to load. I did get a lot of tips for the loading screens, but I would still rather have faster loading.\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- The weapon system. I think I figured out what they were going for: since there is no crafting or repair system for weapons and shields, this is the way the game upgrades your effectiveness. As you complete shrines and divine beasts the weapons slowly improve. Actually the enemies not all of them) slowly upgrade as well to be more difficult, thereby dropping improved weapons. It\\'s supposed to be an organic thing, which it is up to a certain point.\\n- the motion controls: technically they \"work\" but I didn\\'t appreciate them for things like aiming the bow so the first thing I did was turn them off. There are still shrines that make you use them though.\\n- the plot: not over the top great, no great twists or anything. Just a pretty straight forward thing. It\\'s kind of like the plot of the movie \"the blues brothers\" now that I think about it. Link is \"getting the band back together\" for one last gig. And also bailing someone out of tough situation. Except link doesn\\'t have a partner, it\\'s just him trying to talk people into fighting again coming to the aid somebody. It\\'s actually pretty impressive the way they pieced the plot together through these \"memories\" that are entirely optional and can be watched in any order yet still fits together into a cohesive whole by the end.\\n- optional quests and mini-games. To expand your inventory capacity (for melee weapons/bows/shields) you have to trade in korok seeds. You find korok seeds but searching out of the way places for things that \"seem out of place\". Like a circle of rocks obviously missing a piece to make a full circle. Complete the circle, get a seed. Collect enough seeds and trade them for more inventory capacity. So you explore the world, solve some minor puzzles and in trade you \"earn\" more inventory space. It seems fair (I found just under 200 seeds, which sounds like a lot until you find out there\\'s 900 total). There\\'s also a take-a-pic-of-everything mini game thing. I was wondering at the start why there was no central repository explaining all the various enemies. And then I got the thing that allowed for photo taking. So it\\'s \"build-your-own beastiary\". I don\\'t know that there\\'s a reward for a complete repository. But it is helpful. There\\'s also some other mini-games like gliding for the longest and riding a shield down a snow path. Those are fun more than anything.\\n- the way the monsters (and most everything else) re-spawns: I think I like it. I mean it\\'s kind of explained in the context of the plot and it\\'s relatively predictable. I once got stuck on a certain island the night before that re-spawn event. It was like living through \"groundhog day\" having to beat the island multiple times to try and finish it. In the \"late game\" you may start to plan all your adventures around the next re-spawn.\\n\\nPositives:\\n- It is a very compelling open world. I spent many a night exploring random areas, trying to finish puzzles in shrines and fighting various mini bosses. It\\'s often hard to put down.\\n- the gained abilities from the start of the game makes it very fun to experiment. And the shrines make you \"think outside the box\" in your creative use of these abilities to solve the puzzle.\\n- speaking of abilities, almost always when i couldn\\'t figure out puzzle the answer seemed to be \"use crynosis\" (giant pillar of ice). Not sure why I had so much trouble remembering that was a thing.\\n- I actually like a lot of the mini bosses. The Hinox (giant one-eyed things that seem to enjoy sleeping) were intimidating at first but eventually quite fun to fight. And a good source of relatively high power bows. Among other things.\\n- the recipe/cooking system. I still don\\'t know all the super-great recipes by name/by heart. But I know enough the create enhancements for speed/stealth/heart recovery/recovery+extra hearts/attack up/defense up/recover stamina/extra stamina wheels. And that\\'s what I really want anyway. Never did figure out what good all those blocks of salt are for. Guess that\\'s why I have hundreds of them.\\n- I like the logic of the game. For instance in the starter area is a required shrine but the area is too cold to go through without losing hearts. You only have three hearts so this is rather important. There are hints of a recipe that will provide cold resistance as well as a way to get a warm vest. But I didn\\'t know how to cook or that the \"warm doublet\" was an option. So as is probably logical i used a torch to provide just enough warmth to get through the cold area. Of course there are also bad guys to get through along the way and the torch goes out when you switch to a weapon so then you have to find some place to re-light a torch. You can also light wood weapons on fire of course. And actually where you start finding element enhanced weapons this works the same way: in the hot desert equip a great ice sword to stay a little cooler (and a fireblade to stay a little warmer). There\\'s also things like ice-based enemies that die in one hit with a fire weapon, and fire enemies that die from ice weapons. Just makes sense.\\n- Actually, you indirectly learn how to do with lightning strikes pretty quickly (if you have metal weapons equipped you\\'ll likely get struck by lightning). And this knowledge comes in handy with the electricity-based puzzles (metal weapons conduct electricity). As does water. Comes in handy for disabling groups of enemies standing in water.\\n- It seems like for every \"that\\'s not fair\" element you find there is a \"that\\'s very generous of you\" element to counter it. For instance it\\'s not at all difficult to stumble across an enemy entirely over your head in abilities/hit points/etc. and can insta-kill you without much more than a look. As if to counter this you have the transportation/beam out ability you get pretty much first thing. At any moment/any time you can bring up the map and warp away without any consequences of any kind. About to drown? Or part way up a mountain and out of stamina? Laser about the take your head off? No problem, bring up the map and warp away. Doesn\\'t cost any rupees or hearts or anything nor are there restrictions around enemies being around etc. Insta-gone.\\n- the armor system: lets just say collect everything you see that you can pick up. Every much room, every firefly, every apple, every horn. Because you will need it, and I don\\'t think there\\'s any sort of limit to how big that stack of teeth can get (or I didn\\'t find the limit, anyway). You\\'ll need it to upgrade your armor, which you will want to do for the \"set bonus\". There\\'s the fireproof suit for walking around on death mountain without instantly catching on fire. There\\'s the rock climbing suit for super fast climbing, there\\'s the sheika outfit for super-stealth, there also one for extreme cold and extreme heat. The one that allows for walking around inside in a volcano doesn\\'t help for traveling in the desert. Not sure why. Point is you will probably want that extreme cold outfit upgrade so you\\'re \"unfreezable\" and the rubber suite upgraded so your \"unshockable\". And extreme heat one so you\\'re not dressed as...well lets not spoil the surprise.\\n- the combat system: the sooner you learn the parry/super dodge system the better off you\\'ll be. Took me forever to get the hang of it. But it\\'s definitely worth it. Lets just say you can kill the guardians in the starter area with nothing more than a pot lid...\\n\\nHow much one likes this game I think will be directly proportional to how open one is to open world games (like the elder scrolls series). I never had any trouble figuring out where to go or what to do next in this game (and Impa is there to remind you). The plot is entirely optional as are the \"divine beasts\" and 116 of 120 shrines. You can waste time time and do whatever you want in any random order you like. That\\'s either terrifyingly flexible or wonderfully freeing, depending on your tastes. Think of it as a really watered down version of all the famous open world franchises. Which isn\\'t a bad thing.\\n\\nOne tip to leave you with: that area around Zora\\'s domain, the long windy road with all the lizard men, that is definitely the place for gathering arrows. And you will run low on arrows...a lot. I was doing that every re-spawn time for a while there.', '10': 'I\\'ve put somewhere between 50-75 hours into this game and I have to say that I just don\\'t get the gushing, unqualified love for this game. In fact, after about 10-15 hours, I was pretty close to just giving up on it, but I kept playing it expecting for it to click. It never did. In my view, it\\'s a OK game, but that\\'s it. It\\'s not the best game on the Switch, and it\\'s not the best game in its genre.\\n\\nThe good:\\n- The developers obviously put a lot of time into the game, and it shows. There are a lot of different landscapes, the artwork is interesting, and I can only remember one bug in all the time that I played. It is a polished, finished game. Especially with large, open-world games, that\\'s pretty rare, and I appreciate that.\\n\\n- The controls are solid, although there is some awkward button-mashing required in spots that can be frustrating. This is particularly true for the dodge mechanic, which requires a three-button combination that, if not executed just right, will just result in a crouch that gets you clobbered by a bad guy.\\n\\n- It\\'s suitable for children, which is nice. Few of these types of games are.\\n\\nThe not so good:\\n- The game is awfully repetitive. There is a really big, open, world, and that\\'s great. Many of the areas have different artwork and are pretty to look at. But really, most of the territories are basically the same with different artwork layered over the top.\\n\\n-With a big, open world, you would expect that there would be a lot to do. There\\'s really not, at least as far as I can tell. There is a main quest and there is discovering shrines. There are a handful of side quests, but they\\'re pretty one-dimensional and involve either discovering a shrine or running an errand for someone. Other games like this (Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA, etc.) have some pretty involved B stories that can be just as good as the main game.\\n\\n-BOTW is full of some interesting ideas that are executed in a way that just makes the game too tedious and downright boring in spots. For example:\\n\\n- There are something like 120 shrines to discover. That sounds like a lot, but all the shrines fall into one of three categories: a fight, a platformer, or a puzzle. Every shrine is a variation of one of those three, and with 120, that gets pretty old. In Fallout 3, a much better game, each Vault had a different story and was relatively unique. Because of that, they were quite fun and interesting to explore. There\\'s nothing interesting about the shrines in BOTW once you play the first few. Beating the shrines is important to level up your character, though, so there is a lot of repetitive grinding.\\n\\n- There are a lot of mountains and cliffs in the game. It makes for interesting landscape, and you can climb them, which is a cool and different idea, but climbing is very slow, and some of the cliffs are quite big. It\\'s just boring to sit there for 45-60 seconds doing nothing but holding the climb button. Worse, sometimes it rains and the cliffs become too slick to climb. But if you need to go up the cliff to get where you\\'re going, there is nothing to do but stand there and wait for it to stop raining. I\\'ve actually just put down the controller and left to make myself a sandwich while I waited for it to stop raining. What\\'s the point of that?\\n\\n-Speaking of rain, the weather changes. That\\'s neat I guess, but they\\'ve messed it up by making it a game mechanic. Sometimes it will storm, so if you are holding a metal weapon or a metal shield, you\\'ll get struck by lightning and die (this also causes an inventory management problem, which I discuss below). It rains a lot in the game but doesn\\'t always storm, so it\\'s easy to miss when it starts if you\\'re not paying attention. You\\'ll just be wandering around and then get struck by lighting and instantly die. That\\'s annoying. It also goes from extreme hot to extreme cold rather quickly. If you don\\'t have the proper clothing, you will die very quickly. So for example, in the desert, the daytime is very hot and the nighttime is very cold; each require special outfits. This might be realistic, but time passes quickly and it gets old to have to keep changing outfits every five minutes. Again, how is this a fun game mechanic?\\n\\n-There is a big, open-world map, so getting from place to place can be tedious. Other open-world games, like Fallout or Witcher, solve this problem by being able to fast travel basically anywhere. You can fast travel in BOTW, too, but you are limited to being able to fast travel only to two types of locations: towers and shrines. That means that after you fast travel, you often have a lot of walking (or worse, climbing) to get to where you want to go. That\\'s boring. You can also get a horse, but because so much of the map is mountainous, their utility is rather low.\\n\\n- Your weapons and shields deteriorate. That\\'s fine, plenty of other games have done that. But in those games, there is a way to repair your equipment. In this game, there isn\\'t, and most of the weapons will deteriorate very quickly--just a handful of fights with monsters. So you have this perverse incentive when you get good weapons to not use them because of a concern that they will break and then you won\\'t have them later for the boss battles or occasional more powerful monster that you run across.\\n\\n- By itself, the deterioration issue probably wouldn\\'t be terrible. When it is combined with a limited inventory and specialized weapons, it becomes downright awful. You only have a few weapons slots, but you have to horde weapons because you never know when they might break. Worse, some monsters a particularly vulnerable to a single type of weapon--ice sword, fire sword, etc. So you always want to make sure you have one of each of those. And, when it storms, you can\\'t use a metal weapon, so you have to keep a wooden weapon, too. You wind up always fretting about what weapons to keep and which to drop, and when. It\\'s frustrating to drop a weapon that you need later because you didn\\'t have room for it at the time. It\\'s just unnecessary.\\n\\n-To recover health, you have to cook meals in a pot. That\\'s fine, but it takes a lot of time and clicks to gather items out of your inventory and then a few more seconds for them to actually cook. It doesn\\'t sound like much, but if you want to prepare 10-15 meals to prepare for a boss battle (or because you don\\'t have the proper equipment and need the temporary boost that a meal provides), it\\'s really tiresome to sit at the fire and do stuff over and over again.\\n\\n- There are really only a handful of different monsters you fight. The monsters that you meet in the first few minutes of the game will be seen through the rest of the game, except more powerful. When you go to a new area, it\\'s basically the same monsters, except there is an \"ice\" version, a \"fire\" version, or a \"skeleton\" version.\\n\\nIn sum, the bones are here for a good game, but it\\'s just not a good game. I can tell they put a lot of work into the game, and for that I am appreciative. But gosh, shouldn\\'t the game be fun? Three stars is as high as I can go, and that might even be a bit generous.\\n\\nIf you like the open world game, you\\'ve probably already played many of the games that are far and away better than BOTW. Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, GTA and Witcher (available on Switch) are clearly better. If you are looking for an open world game that is suitable for a child, Lego City Undercover (available on Switch) is better than BOTW, and usually half the price. If you also have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that has the same motif as BOTW, but is much, much better in nearly every way.'}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'rand_index', '_id': 'zefBc40B-Q_i0rt4NUxG', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.11.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'RoboCop Rogue City (PS5)', 'Product Price': '59', 'Product Rating': '4.4', 'Product Number of Rates': '133 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/71Edr6Q7Y4L._SY445_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Get ready to…PROTECT THE INNOCENT AND UPHOLD THE LAW Armed with your trusty Auto-9, factory-built strength, years of experience on the force and a variety of tools at your disposal, you will fight forces seeking to destroy the city you call home in an all new first-person, explosive hunt for the truth You have the power to decide how to fulfil prime directives in your own way, but as the story unfolds proceed with caution because corruption and greed know no limits Prepare yourself to...

As a child, the Robocop theme song was always playing through my head—as I played, as I created—as I did anything I loved. When I saw this game was coming out, I instantly preordered. I have a huge collection of Robocop memorabilia and I still believe it is one of the greatest action films to come out of the 80s—and still one of the greatest of all time. So, take that with a grain of salt. Some of my friends were sure this was going to be a buggy mess—I am happy to say that Alex Murphy returns to cleanse the streets and not a day has passed to wash away this nuke-filled 80s Detroit. We have Peter Weller reprising his role. We have a love for the source material on full display from the developers. And when I was let into the building to begin mowing down thugs at the beginning of the game that old rousing score had a permanent smile on my face until the conclusion of the mission. I have to say, the developers got this right! Now, there are some bugs and some rough edges. I had to restart a mission because my gun site got fastened to my visor at one point. The cutscene characters kind of pop in on PS5–maybe a patch could fix—every NPC punk yells about how you destroyed their hand, and sometimes you can literally launch a biker into space with a robopunch—but this stuff is great. The environmental destruction is a nice touch. The M9 rocks as you would expect, and although Robo is slow, it helps sell the narrative that you are an unstoppable tank. Try not to smile when you marry a punk’s skull with a computer monitor. As a child of the 80s, I have been starved for something that does Robocop justice, and this game has finally given us a sequel to wash the remake and Robocop 3 away. I hope this team sticks with 80s properties or more Robocop! While it is not technical perfection, it is trying to do something that shooters don’t attempt these days. Did I mention Robocop has dialogue options? As a kid I always wanted him to realize his humanity and now I get to do that too! Happy and surprised by this new 80s action dream come true!', '2': 'As a die hard fan of the original Robocop film from 1987, i am very impressed with this game. Peter Weller (the original robocop actor from parts 1 and 2) returns to provide the voice. Overall the story had a lot of depth to it. Gameplay was fun. Decisions you make as robocop can affect the outcome of events. It captures the spirit of the movie with the bloody violence, social satire and all other elements of the 1987 original', '3': 'I feel like these games only come along once or twice in a decade. Be it Predator: Concrete Jungle, Ghostbusters, Alien: Isolation and now RoboCop: Rogue City there are these instances of games that are made with such a slavish focus on details of the original source material while also serving as a continuation to the story as a sequel would that for a fan of that franchise of films you can feel well and truly satisfied with the production. These types of projects are rare and they only happen once and there are never sequels so with this new RoboCop game I really took my time and savored all the wonderful fan service the devs decided to put into it.\\n\\nStory wise this game takes place between the films RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 and they spin a pretty interesting yarn it also explains a few plot holes that the third film had. It definitely had more walking and talking sections than I would have expected from a RoboCop game which didn’t end up being a negative for me.\\n\\nGameplay is pretty standard old school shooter stuff, it’s basically a mix of the newer Doom games and the original Crysis. I don’t mean to sell it short with that description but how else can you describe being a walking tank with a pistol that absolutely shreds enemies. There is even a mod you can get later into the game that adds even more gore to your shooting, definitely not a game for the squeamish about blood and guts and dismemberment. There are a host of other firearms you can use but I was just having too much fun with the iconic RoboCop gun to really use any of them.\\n\\nIt’s got a solid campaign that lasted for around 15 hours and I really took my time and explored everything I could and still found that I missed some things. As of this writing there is no NG+ option and it has a couple of DLCs that only offer cosmetic changes to RoboCop and his pistols appearances.\\n\\nMy copy was for the PS5 and I have to warn anyone that at the time of this writing the game is quite buggy on PS5. I experience everything from audio glitches, textures not loading correctly, NPC facial animations not syncing with their dialogue, one colossal instance of frame rate drop, and at one point the game even loaded a completely different level than it was supposed to and left me wandering around thinking it was part of the narrative for a half an hour before I just restarted the game. I know it sounds like a lot but it was over the course of 15 hours and once I learned to just restart the game at the first sign of trouble I didn’t really have an issue afterwards. Hopefully they get it patched and working properly before my second play through.', '4': 'AAA studios could learn from this comparably small developer!

Like many Wii U titles, this one was a gem overlooked due to the Wii U\\'s low sales. Also like many Wii U exclusives, it means that so many missed out on it the first time. What makes Super Mario 3D World so special is that it\\'s simply among the best Mario experiences you could have. It takes the best of Mario\\'s 2D adventures and combined it with (then) the best of Mario\\'s 3D adventures. It was the ultimate time capsule of everything that made Mario great, and so many people missed out on it. It is still a quint essential experience for Mario fans simply because of the time capsule it is, and remains even as Super Mario Odyssey has hit the scene.\\n\\nMario games are never a plot driven affair. Normally they all involve Peach getting kidnapped and Mario going to save her. This one is different. In this one, however, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach find a magic pipe that looks to be in disrepair. Mario and Luigi fix it... only for a Sprixie to emerge and explain to Mario and company that Bowser has come and imprisoned much of their population. She only speaks briefly before Bowser comes from the pipe, traps her in a jar and disappears. Fearing the worst, Mario and company hop into the pipe to go to this new world.\\n\\nThe plot setup, if you couldn\\'t tell, is largely ripped from the US version of Super Mario Bros. 2, only this time it isn\\'t a dream. Also like Super Mario Bros. 2, you can choose between the four heroes: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach. Each one has the abilities that made them worthwhile in that first outing way back in 1988. Mario is perfectly balanced, Luigi jumps the highest, Toad is the fastest and Peach can briefly hover in the air. There aren\\'t a ton of reasons to use one character over another, however. Most of the stages are designed to be traversed in a similar manner.\\n\\nThe game mixes the best of 2D and 3D Mario adventures. The game has a level by level design and a world map like 2D Mario games, but the over map acts as a hub similar to 3D Mario games. This means that instead of Mario following a pre-determined path you\\'re actually free to explore the map without going on a track like in previous adventures. Sometimes you want to do this. The worldmaps sometimes contain Toad houses for items, 1UP Mushrooms, coins or even divergent paths to certain bonuses. Each time you complete a level you unlock new levels, sometimes multiple levels, and you don\\'t have to complete every single stage to get to Bowser. There are even warp pipes (though not very many).\\n\\nEach stage centers around a concept. You\\'re always introduced to this concept in a safe environment before it ramps it up. What makes this intersting for Super Mario 3D World is that it manages to make every level feel unique, experimental and fresh. Even if a concept gets repeated, there\\'s an intersting twist on it that completely changes how you interact with it. You can get a small idea of what the concept is before jumping in. The stages themselves are usually fairly straight forward, but there are certain things to keep in mind as you go. The main goal of every level is to make it to the flag pole, but every level also contains green stars. Collecting these is important. As the game progresses you\\'ll need them to unlock levels the further you get. Luckily there are green stars found in other places too such as mystery box stages, or doing the Captain Toad Treasure Tracker mini game. There are also stamps to collect in each stage, though this doesn\\'t add much. It\\'s just a collectible.\\n\\nMario and company also have the ability to use various different suits and powerups. In most 3D Mario games, Mario\\'s powerups are temporary, but here it takes a page primarily from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World where the powerups are permanent until you get hit, and where you can store one to swap out at any time. There are familiar power ups. The majority of which you\\'ve seen before. The fire flower is a staple. The game also gives you the boomerang suit once again from Super Mario 3D Land, the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 returns, and so does the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. The big introduction here, however, is the cat suit. With it you can use a forward attack to hit any enemies in your way, do a front dive, and climb up walls. This is especially useful as you can also climb the flagpole at the end of a level for a free 1UP with the catsuit equipped. There are also temporary powerups that can\\'t be taken out of a level, but are useful when you find them. There\\'s an ice skate in some ice levels that you can ride around it, propeller boxes to hover, and also mobile cannons you can carry around.\\n\\nIn addition, Mario has access to a lot of moves he normally only has in 3D games. Mario can long jump, backflip, side jump, and wall jump. This allows for more flexibility within the level design, and sometimes this encourages you to explore in the levels themselves.\\n\\nSuper Mario 3D World doesn\\'t provide a huge challenge. Instead the engagement is based on the game\\'s rather intersting level designs and tight platforming. If there is one game which demonstrates the absurdity of a life count in this day and age it is most certainly the Mario series (which, thankfully, Odyssey did away with). Super Mario 3D is going to shower you with 1UPs. Even if you falter, it\\'s not unusual to find enough coins, hidden 1UPs or reach the top of a flagpole. Even more than that, if you fail at a stage more than 5 times, the game offers you a Super Leaf that will make you invincible to enemies to get through it. This is purely optional, but the point is that Super Mario 3D World isn\\'t really out to punish you for screw ups.\\n\\nWhat CAN make the game unusually challenging, however, is multiplayer. Much like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, 3D World supports up to 4 players simultaneously. This can make some courses easier, but more often than not multiplayer is a hazardous experience that will be prone to ending friendships. In the first place, the camera only really centers on player one. More importantly it\\'s easier to do such things as pick up friends and throw them into pits, jump on them and screw them up, or just get in each others way. This doesn\\'t multiplayer can\\'t be fun, it just means that if you\\'re goal is progress through a stage you may find that this is a much bigger challenge when some courses require everyone to be on the same page. You can also play multiplayer online, but this has had mixed results (at least for me) and is even worse simply because a precise platformer like Super Mario 3D World... was simply not made for lag, should you encounter it. Stick with local multiplayer here if you\\'re looking to play with friends.\\n\\nThere are a few noticeable differences from the Wii U version. The most eye-popping is that the game simply has a cleaner look and is playing at a much higher resolution. In fact, the game overall runs much faster. Characters move through levels faster, and everything flows much better. This is going to make you think that levels are short, but really it\\'s just that progress through them is much quicker than you remember. You no longer have access to the Miiverse, which is no big loss. But the biggest addition here is \"Bowser\\'s Fury,\" which is a new game in which you get to explore an island collecting Cat Shines. Every now and then Bowser will surface, you\\'ll have to hide from him as he wrecks havoc, and then you\\'ll resume. Once you\\'ve found enough in any given area you can become Giga Mario in cat form and battle Bowser. At first this seems fun, but the reality is that it gets old really fast. It looks beautiful, it flows seamlessly, but after a couple of hours of it, you\\'re just going to go back to 3D World.\\n\\nIf there were any downsides to Super Mario 3D World it would primarily be that some aspects of Mario games are not quite as charming as they once were. I mentioned the life system feels obsolete in a game that is so quick to dole out so many lives. The timer also doesn\\'t feel necessary anymore. The only time you\\'ll feel like time is of the essence is if you get stuck trying to find one last green star, only to have to start a level over again because of time. But the timer simply isn\\'t that big a deal, or that constricting. It just doesn\\'t really have a reason to be here other than because 2D Mario games once used it. Neither of these things is really detracting from the game, but it\\'s hard not to notice them.\\n\\nAll of that said, it\\'s hard not to admire the creativity put into the game\\'s levels and design. Super Mario 3D World remains one of Mario\\'s best outings. It takes the best of 2D Mario games and combines them with the best of the 3D games. It allows for Super Mario 3D World to represent the best of what the Mario series has offered us over time. Given that Mario\\'s next major outing to follow 3D World originally was Super Mario Odyssey, it felt like a love letter back in the days of the Wii U before Mario would evolve once again. Today, it serves as a reminder of where Mario has been as we remember the legacy he has created. It is a worthwhile game to play and delightful for Mario fans. Especially those who enjoyed the games that Super Mario 3D World opts to pay tribute to.', '2': \"I got this game as a treat for myself for my birthday. Having never played the original Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, this is a must buy if you're a Mario fan.\\nIt's only been a few days, but I've had tons of fun with the game already. It's perfect to pick up and play with some friends, family, or some roommates! Personally, it's a great game for me to chill out. The whole campaign is fun, and a bit of a visual upgrade from the WiiU. The new mode is very fun, and beautiful to look at!\", '3': 'This is my review after playing this game for almost 2 months.\\nI never owned a WiiU system, so this game was perfect for me. The main plot is about bowser kidnapping the sprixie fairies, and in this game you can play as peach now that she isn’t kidnapped. (You can also play as rosalina after beating world star-2, peach and rosalina are perfect for little sisters, Princess lovers, etc) You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, and Rosalina. All have their ups and downs.\\nMario- most balanced of them all, not much to say\\nLuigi- jumps higher but slides a little\\nToad- runs fast, but is small and can’t jump very high\\nPeach- can float, but doesn’t run that fast\\nRosalina- honestly the most op character, can’t think of a bad thing about her but she’s like Mario but with the spin move from super Mario galaxy.\\n\\nThe multiplayer gets criticized for being, “too chaotic”, but in my opinion, it’s the most fun I’ve had for a while.\\nThe game has 11 worlds In total.\\nWorld 1- the easiest world, very grass themed and made to introduce new players, not the best to replay\\nWorld 2- desert themed, a little bit harder than world 1\\nWorld 3- Ice themed, has lots of fun, creative levels (such as the super Mario kart snes themed level)\\nWorld 4- Also desert, very challenging\\nWorld 5- also ice, world 5 has some fun levels such as the golden express\\nWorld 6- cloud themed, the best world in the game in my opinion, lots of creative levels\\nWorld Castle (7)- lava themed, {spoiler alert} not the final world in the game, but a very fun one and very replayable\\nWorld Bowser (8)- carnival themed, this world is bad*ss. The big bowser animatronic, the music, and that’s just the hub world. This is home to some very challenging levels too.\\nWorld star- space themed, very fun levels and awesome new unlockable character.\\nWorld mushroom- harder remixes of other levels, very fun and hard\\nWorld flower- like world mushroom, but with different levels and more harder\\nWorld crown- the hardest levels in the game, such as champions road\\n\\nAnd that’s just the worlds. There are also the power ups.\\nMushroom- gives you a boost in life, turns small Mario into big Mario\\nFire flower- throws fireballs\\nStar- invincible for about 5 seconds\\nSuper bell- turns you into cat Mario, you can pounce and scratch and climb and dive.\\nTanooki leaf- turns you into tanooki Mario, you can float and stuff\\nBoomerang- you can shoot boomerangs\\nThere are more, but those are the main ones.\\nSuper Mario 3D world is fun. But we haven’t talked about bowsers fury, the new content.\\n\\nIn bowsers fury you go around lake lapcat collecting cat shines. Collect enough to get the giga bell to fight fury bowser. Bowser jr also helps you because he wants his dad back to normal. The lake lapcat is full of cat trees, enemies, and even pigeons. Every thing is cat themed.\\nThis game is fairly short and I 100%ed it In a month (I could have 100%ed it faster, but I was also playing 3D world)\\n\\nOverall this whole game is worth $60.\\nBut only if you don’t have 3D world. This game is not worth the $60 price if you also have 3D world. Bowsers fury is NOT worth $60. If They released it separately, it would be about $20. This game is mainly for players you haven’t experienced the original 3D world yet. 3D world is the game I usually play, bowsers fury is a fun side, but again, it’s not worth a whole $60.\\nOther than that, awesome game. 9.5/10 and a big 5 star rating.', '4': 'Love switch games, this game is really cool', '5': 'Super fun game(s)', '6': \"I got this game so that my daughters and I could play it. We love our Nintendo Switch, and we especially love any of the games with Mario. We were all very excited to give this one a try. We've been having a lot of fun playing this game. This game has is a really good quality game and it's a lot of fun. My daughters have especially loved playing it. They play this when they have friends over as well. It's an entertaining game for all of us. We really love it!\", '7': \"Hard to believe that this past year, we celebrated the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. While it had not been as strong as many gamers had expected, we still got a lot of great toys and games featuring Nintendo's proud mascot. We got the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package, which had Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine & Super Mario 64. But other Mario titles flowed to the Switch as well like Paper Mario: The Origami King. Still, when you look at games from the Wii U, you had almost all of the Mario games go to Switch already, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe. But one game that has not made it to Switch until now is Super Mario 3D World. The game was well-received for Wii U owners, but not as strongly sold, due to the lackluster sales of Wii U. Still, Nintendo pressed on and decided to release it for the Switch. Sadly, the game was suppose to be released last year, but got held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it is here, with a added bonus.\\n\\nSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, is a 2-in-1 purr-fectly conjured compilation where Super Mario 3D World is remastered and includes new features made for Switch, and the new mini-adventure Bowser's Fury which takes a unique twist on the Mario formula. First for Super Mario 3D World, the game looks great and brings in all the wonderfully made platforming from the Wii U game, with some small tweaks to make it work a bit better. In the game, Mario & his friends need to rescue Pixie Princesses that Bowser and his minions have captured. Along the way, Mario, Peach, Toad & Luigi each all maneuver with new and returning features like the thrilling Cat Suit, which allows Mario & friends to maneuver in new and challenging ways. You can now climb up walls, attack like a feline and skid through pathways that are more challenging than ever. You also have courses that are new for Switch owners to hover through like Red-Hot Run, The Great Goal Pole, and the towering Champion's Road which will get you screaming for more.\\n\\nYou also have a new game here: Bowser's Fury, where Mario must team-up with Bowser Jr. in a epic quest to save Bowser from a uncontrollable raging toxin where got into and becomes Fury Bowser (a towering Ganon-like creature) bent on mayhem to destroy Lake Lapcat. In this game, Mario must partner with Bowser Jr. on the quest to save Bowser from the raging being he has became. The game plays more like a Super Mario Odyssey adventure with Mario 3D World twists, packed-down into 1 major overworld. In the game, Mario and Bowser fight cat-themed foes like Boom Boom, Bullies and unlock puzzles and collect items and find the guarded cat shines to unlock bells that will help Mario & Bowser Jr. stop the unraveled Fury Bowser. The game itself is fun, but does feel interesting as a concept to make a condensed Super Mario 64-esque game. It works well, and the game looks amazing with the designs and platforming. In itself, the campaign may be short, but will take your fiery breath away when you play it. I think it looks charming and puts in a new wrinkle on the Mario 3D platforming formula that worked so well from past games like Super Mario Galaxy 2.\\n\\nThere are a lot of things that work well with both of these games, with a few faults though. First of all, for Bowser's Fury, for skilled gamers of past Mario platformers, they may find the game shorter than other Mario titles, because of the main overworld. Some gamers would've wanted more overworld packed into the hub-world like earlier Mario titles, but it is actually interesting to put Mario into a Luigi's Mansion kind of setting. Also, you would also have to toggle with many different power-ups at once while battling Fury Bowser in the game that you may need that as a lifeline without losing lives. It may be shocking but sadly it is what it takes at times while controlling Mario & Bowser Jr. while mastering Bowser's Fury. While it may be repetitive, it still is a lot of fun playing. As for Super Mario 3D World, the main disadvantage is only if you have mastered the Mario adventure before from the Wii U era, you may not feel entertained with this game all over again. But nevertheless, considered that so many people never played the Wii U title, considered it was one of the weakest-selling game system from the Nintendo legacy, it still is worth playing at the end.\\n\\nWhen you look at Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, it is a mixed bag for some fans of the Super Mario Brothers legacy. But nevertheless, it is a absolutely fun title worth checking out. You get two adventures of the furry-kind into one package that does work. While many people may feel Super Mario 3D World is not a strong buy, it is a strong buy because it is 2 adventures into one nearly purr-fect pair of escapades. As for Bowser's Fury, I did get what I wanted out of it, and would still want to intrigued with more when I missed on it. Still for what it is worth, pairing the 2 games in one compilation is worth the money. If they were sold apart, it would not be worth purchasing. Still, I absolutely recommend buying this game pack a lot. It can come across as a great pair of actual purr-fect strangers.\\n\\nGraphics: A-\\n\\nSound: B+\\n\\nControl: B+\\n\\nFun & Enjoyment: Super Mario 3D World: A- for Solo: B+ for Multiplayer Bowser's Fury: B For Solo & Multiplayer\\n\\nOverall: B+\", '8': 'I really liked Mario 3D World when it launched on Wii U several years ago and was eager to play it again. This is a great upgrade with a huge expansion and good quality-of-life tweaks.\\n\\nThe core game is one of my favorite Mario platformers: it has classic and new Mario powerups in an easy-to-follow 3D setting. It really feels like classic SNES Mario World but with a little extra depth. Unlike the \"New Super Mario Bros\" sidescrolling games, this one gives you enough space to play with 4 people and not get in each others\\' way. You can work together or engage in some battletoads-style friendly sabotage. It\\'s got lots of variety and lots of levels. If you liked the realistic open worlds of Mario Odyssey or Galaxy this might feel too simple, but if you like the old-school style of Mario 3 or NSMB, this really captures that.\\n\\nThis Switch re-make has identical visuals and all the original content with a few perks- the movement is overall faster and controls better than it did before, making the whole game feel a little smoother and snappier.\\n\\nBut the \"Bowser\\'s Fury\" expansion is a huge value-add. It is accessible from the start menu but is essentially a whole extra open-world with a lot of new ideas. It\\'s much more open and challenging with a great 2P co-op mode and a fun kaiju-monster-battle element as you try to evade godzilla-sized bowser until you can power up to his level and have giant-size boss fights. It\\'s not as long as the main game but it kept me going for several days to get all the shines. It really feels like a return to Mario 64, but with more powerups and smooth controls and camera.

I have played almost every release of HAL Laboratory\\'s pink creation, almost with passion. Kirby Superstar always was one of my favorite Nintendo 1st party title. But as I got older and I moved onto PS2 and GBA, fact Kirby stayed 2D even when Mario was getting 2.5 and 3D treatment was slowly baffling me.\\n\\nThen, one day, for GameCube, a E3 demo surfaced. One that featured my favorite pink cute creature, running around saving Dream Land! I was awed! I loved it! I really wanted it! It would have given me reasons to buy GameCube, which I held off on, because I was getting distant from Zelda titles (which I still care 0 for), and only game I grew interest in became MGS Twin Snakes, which I highly recommend.\\n\\nI waited forever for the title to release.\\n\\nFrom 2005, we fast-forward, now we\\'re here.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m fully aware this game has been built from the scratch, not related to this beautiful game at all. And it\\'s long been confirmed that the GCN and possible Wii edition that it may have existed all went in dumpster only after being in development hell for 11 years. BUT. YOU HAVE NO FREAKING IDEA HOW MUCH THE WORLD NEEDED THIS GAME. Every platformer copy steal ability game lands itself beautifully to our wonderful pinkball here.\\n\\nAnd Kirby is here to rightfully take that back from you. Or suck it out of you.\\n\\nRight out of the box, game plays short cutscene and there\\'s 0 punch holding. You\\'re taken straight into the tutorial, reminded of the familiar controls.\\n\\nAnd then WHAT?! I CAN BE A CAR KIRBY NOW?!\\n\\nAnd the area can beautifully demolishable just as how previous Kirby games have been, has platform area that you can fall and oof into, just as previous Kirby games have been, but this formula finally got re-perfected in the name of our Holy Pinkness finally fit for the generation that only knows Kirby as that Super Smash Bros. character that is annoying to fight against.\\n\\nNow I will add back that I have only been playing for about 1h, but this new game almost plays like a journey. You\\'re finding out conspiracy on how you ended up in this Forgotten Land, accompanied by beautiful Japanese song (that probably is definitely the first one!), great orchestra-based OST, and did I mention that Car Kirby is freaking adorable? I heard he has few or form and I\\'m very eager to find out rest of them.\\n\\nIf you\\'re long fan of older Kirby titles, I am wondering why you\\'re reading my reviews instead of already snagging this title. It feels like nothing new for first few minutes, but that\\'s some of the beauty of the Kirby series. The gameplay feels like something you can jump back into almost any time, even if you haven\\'t played Kirby game since Kirby Superstar. But there\\'s enough new tricks introduced to keep you busy and wondering around the new Forgotten Land for good few hours. Considering last Kirby title was fairly short and took me only about 3 days of casual play to get near 100% completion, I\\'m hoping this one has far more to offer, which it already has. If you played a lot of platformer, this new Kirby title will keep you busy some time, it got some easy puzzles and here and there moment of \"wait why is that there?!\" moments.\\n\\nI think I mentioned Car Kirby is freaking cute already? Lol.\\n\\nSo far, 100/100. I haven\\'t had so much fun with games lately, and this one definitely hits the spot. I love you Kirby. And please don\\'t let my spouse find out I\\'m cheating on them over Kirby.', '2': 'irby and the Forgotten Land is a delightful addition to the beloved Kirby series. The game follows Kirby as he explores a mysterious new land and restores its lost colors, battling enemies and using his signature ability to inhale and copy their abilities along the way.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of Kirby and the Forgotten Land is its vibrant, colorful graphics. The game\\'s environments and characters are beautifully animated, with a wide range of colors and effects that really bring the game to life. The game\\'s soundtrack is also a highlight, with a mix of upbeat tunes and soothing melodies that perfectly complement the action on screen.\\n\\nIn terms of gameplay, Kirby and the Forgotten Land offers a good balance of challenge and accessibility. The game\\'s controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to navigate the levels and defeat enemies. Kirby can also use a variety of power-ups and abilities, such as the new \"Link\" ability that allows him to team up with enemies and use their abilities together. The game also includes a multiplayer mode, allowing up to two players to team up and explore the Forgotten Land together.\\n\\nAnother nice touch in Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the inclusion of hidden collectibles and secrets to discover. Throughout the game, players can find hidden treasures and unlockable content, adding an extra layer of replayability to the game.\\n\\nOne minor issue I had with the game was the somewhat repetitive nature of some of the levels. While the game does introduce new enemies and challenges as you progress, some of the early levels can feel a bit same-y after a while. However, this is a minor complaint, and overall the game is still very enjoyable.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend Kirby and the Forgotten Land to fans of the series, as well as anyone who enjoys platforming games. The game\\'s charming story, vibrant graphics, and fun gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the pink puffball. Whether you\\'re a seasoned Kirby veteran or a newcomer to the series, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is sure to provide hours of enjoyment.', '3': \"I am a huge Kirby fan and have been with the series since 2002. I was left somewhat disappointed with Kirby Star Allies as I felt it was lacking in some key areas. It felt like a decent game however one that played things overly safe. With Kirby and the Forgotten Land HAL Labs have finally made the leap into 3d and it's better than I could have ever imagined.\\n\\nKirby controls excellently in 3d. Everything has been adapted into 3d in a way that feels natural. The camera is mostly fixed with some minor angling that can be done by the player. The levels themselves are consistently creative and enjoyable to play. There's a load of additional content ranging from mini games to the bonus treasure road stages in each world. The music is also fantastic! These are some of my favorite level and boss themes in the series thus far.\\n\\nIn terms of complaints I only have a few and they're minor at best. The game runs at 30fps. It's a stable framerate however it is disappointing when compared to other games on the switch that are more technically demanding and run at higher framerates. In addition objects that are not immediately in your vicinity are rendered at half the framerate which wouldn't be an issue if the game ran at 60fps. It's just jarring to see enemies and items rotating at a choppy 15fps and on the whole it's a tad disappointing given how good the rest of the game looks.\\n\\nSecondly the number of powers is fairly small. There are only 12 which is less than the typical Kirby game which has around 20-25. The saving grace is that abilities can be upgraded which makes a lot of them feel unique. There's also some surprising omissions in terms of copy abilities such as no Wheel, Parasoul, Spark, Beam or Fighter.\\n\\nLastly I wish that the worlds had just a few more stages. Most worlds have on average 4 stages with a few containing 5 excluding the boss stages. The levels themselves are fantastic but I guess I'm being a little greedy because I wish there were a few more.\\n\\nOverall this is an easy recommendation. I think those looking for a relaxing platforming adventure will enjoy this a lot. Anyone on the fence can always try out the free demo for this game located on the Nintendo Switch E-Shop. I love Kirby as a series and I can't wait to see what HAL Labs does next!\", '4': 'Arrived as described, its my first time playing a Kirby game. Its such a fun, aesthetically pleasing and relaxing to play game and is definitely one of my top favorites now. I love open world games where you can run around and explore. To me it feels similar to Mario Odyssey with the different worlds/locations to unlock, collect coins, figures, different helmets and save the waddle dees. The game is not too easy and some are very challenging which I love. Its a must have game!', '5': 'I\\'ll admit that I bought this game for myself as much as I did for my 5-year old. I\\'ve loved Kirby since the original Kirby\\'s Dream Land on the Game Boy (yes, I\\'m that old), played several of the titles since, and I think this was the best one yet. It\\'s a little more mature and better suited for an adult who just wants to play a fun, light game, but still presents a challenge.\\n\\nI played it all the way through to 100% completion on the harder mode. In order to get that 100%, you have to do some pretty challenging tasks, like defeat every boss without taking any damage, including the final boss, serve food at the snack shop in town to angry, impatient customers (much harder than you\\'d think a side mini game should be), catch a giant fish, and go through the hardest setting in the battle arena. It\\'s one of those games that isn\\'t so impossibly hard that it\\'s frustrating, but presents enough of a challenge that it feels like an accomplishment.\\n\\nI also played it through, though not to 100%, with my 5-year old daughter. She has played Mario Kart and Mario Party in the past, but this was very different. She and her 3-year old brother both loved it. It has the perfect \"little helper\" mode where you can have Bandana Waddle Dee join Kirby to assist, but other than going through doors, player 2 can\\'t actually get in the way or cause any trouble. If they stray too far or fall behind, Bandana Waddle Dee just gets teleported right back next to Kirby. If he gets injured, Kirby can give him a high five to give back some health (with a recover period), and if he dies, he just gets a short time out and then player 2 can jump right back into the game. It was a great experience for her, as a learner, to get the idea or how game control works and moving in 3D space.\\n\\nThere is a decent story line that goes along with the game and my sensitive 3-year old was actually quite upset with first ending because you don\\'t fully rescue everyone. Several hours after my daughter and I finished the game, he was crying hysterically (\"I don\\'t like the end of Kirby!\") after I had put him to bed because he was so upset about this. Fortunately, I was able to convince him that it wasn\\'t completely over and we would finish it out and get that final rescue in a couple of days.', '6': 'I am a Nintendo fan but never thought much about Kirby games. Because I now have younger kids, I am often searching for games that are good for kids and families. I tried Kirby All Star Allies and liked it enough to give this one a try after reading reviews.\\n\\nI am so impressed. They put together a masterpiece that I think my kids and me will remember for a long time. Playing Co-op works very well. Both players get a fulfilling sense of involvement. The game is filled with very cleverly designed stages and concepts. It’s not the hardest game, because that’s not the point. The point is to have fun, explore, and enjoy the experience.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar, Kirby can pick up various powers that offer a lot of variety in the gameplay. New to this game is “mouthful mode” where you suck up various larger objects and this creates more unique styles of gameplay (as one example, you can become a soda can vending machine that spits out cans to hurt enemies… and that’s just one of many clever concepts that will leave you smiling ear to ear).\\n\\nAnother really cool thing is Waddle Dee Town. As you save these tiny Waddle Dee creatures, your town gets populated and new things get built. The town is empty at first. Before you know it, you have a cinema, a fishing pond, and various other areas that can keep you entertained and smiling. When I was a child, I played a version of Asteroids where after every few levels the astronaut would return to earth and each time something would be added. Like first no one was there to greet him. Towards the end there was a fancy car and parade. The graphics were so rudimentary but to this day I still remember the experience. Kirby and the Forgotten Land recreates that. I think it’s a game me and my kids will always remember and cherish. I will also mention that while the story is typical Nintendo silly fun, the later stages really draw you in and have you fully invested.\\n\\nThis is a must own for any Nintendo fan.', '7': 'Funny game.

These are mostly neutral colors that are most reminiscent of the Animal Crossing color palette. As an example, I’m an average guy and I really love these colors, they look even better in person. If you resonate with these colors whatsoever, and you want or need some new Joycons, then I highly recommend the two latest sets of these pastel colored Joycons. Enjoy!\\n\\nI didn’t need these, but the colors were just too cute for me to pass up. These pastel colors have a similar look and feel to the Animal Crossing matte/pastel green & blue colors. For those who are unfamiliar, those are the colors that are most associated with the limited edition Animal Crossing themed Nintendo Switch (pre OLED model.) If you’re a fan of that color palette, then you’ll definitely love these. To be honest, being a fan of Animal Crossing definitely influenced my perception of these colors. But they really do look great on my solid white OLED model, plus it never hurts to have some extra Joycons. If you’re a fan of cute colors, Animal Crossing-esc colors, or muted pastel colors; and you’re in the market for new Joycons, then I highly recommend both sets of these new pastel colors. Even if you don’t need new Joycons, but maybe you want to personalize your Switch (like myself) then I still highly recommend them.\\n\\nJust as an example: I’m an average guy, and I still love these pastel colors. I do like cute things to an extent though. (I blame Animal Crossing, K-On!, Lucky Star, and Doki Doki Literature Club!) The pastel colors add character to my Switch, but without coming across as too childish, loud, or obnoxious; such as with the Splatoon 2 color themed Joycons (bright green/hot pink.) Those are cool in their own way, but definitely a little too loud for my tastes.\\n\\nAs an adult, I’d say (tone wise) these have a coolness to them that makes them feel colorful and fun, yet mature, and muted; in other words: I’m not embarrassed to be seen with these pastel colors in public. While these pastel colors may initially come across to some as being a predominantly feminine color palette, they honestly feel pretty neutral. I’d recommend these pastel color sets over all the others.\\n\\nPS: The yellow/pink pastel Joycons are super cute too. The pastel green from this set, and the pastel pink from the other set both look great together. The green and pink are like Splatoon 2 colors, but not nearly as neon, or obnoxious.', '6': 'I’m using Siri to write this since I have extremely low vision.

Joycons are responsive as they should be which is a lot better than the ones my switch came with and for anyone concerned like i was these are compatible with the Oled version (seems silly to worry about but you never know) absolutely loving my joycons and seeing my switch all colorful and not just plain boring white is awesome. No photo because photos absolutely wash out the beautiful pastel color of the joycons. Get them for yourself you’ll see!', '9': 'I ordered these joy cons because the joysticks on the other 3 pairs I had were all drifting to the point of being unable to play anything. One was the original set that came with the console, and the other two were 3rd party ones I’d already “fixed” multiple times. Soooo I was getting kinda desperate at that point.\\n\\nI was on the fence for a bit about whether to try a different 3rd party brand, or try the Nintendo ones. Most reviews on so many different sets were so mixed, which didn’t help. Finally I ended up going with these from Nintendo.\\n\\nI have a chronic illness, and most days I usually do at least a couple hours of gaming on my Switch. Some days I’ll go longer if I’m having a bad day symptom-wise. I’d estimate that half of the time, I’m playing handheld with these joy cons (if I’m playing docked, I use my pro controller). These arrived on April 8th or 9th, and it’s currently September 30th - a little under 6 months. Doing some very rough math, I’d guess I’ve played on these joy cons a minimum of 350-400 hours, but it may be more like 500. So far, no drift. KNOCK ON WOOD. If or when it does happen, I’ll try to remember to update this.\\n\\nAs of now, I would recommend these. I’m not an expert, but my biggest tip with these or any joy cons is to just make sure you’re not leaving them around to gather dust/tiny crumbs/etc especially around the base of the joysticks. In my own experience that seems to be a big trigger for the drifting (at least with 3rd party sets).', '10': 'I had to purchase new ones because I had lost the ones that came with my switch and I’m happy with the controller and the color.'}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'rand_index', '_id': '0efBc40B-Q_i0rt4NUzO', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.11.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.12.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Logitech G923 Racing Wheel and Pedals, TRUEFORCE up to 1000 Hz Force Feedback, Responsive Driving Design, Dual Clutch Launch Control, Genuine Leather Wheel Cover, for PS5, PS4, PC, Mac - Black', 'Product Price': None, 'Product Rating': '4.6', 'Product Number of Rates': '3,160 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/613+EYsHHlL._SX342_.jpg', 'Product Description': '    ', 'Product Reviews': {'1': \"I was very impressed with the overall feel and look of the wheel and pedals.

It's made my racing games so much more exciting! Right from the start, I could tell that Logitech put some serious effort into making this wheel top-notch. The build quality is solid, and it feels comfortable in my hands, even during those long gaming sessions.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the force feedback. It's pretty awesome, I won't lie. When I'm racing, I can actually feel the wheel responding to the road conditions, giving me a more immersive experience. It adds that extra level of realism that gets my heart pumping. And the pedals are no slouch either. They're super responsive, allowing me to accelerate, brake, and shift gears with precision.\\n\\nOh, and here's the best part: the G923 works seamlessly with both PCs and consoles. So, no matter which platform you prefer, you can enjoy the thrills of this racing wheel. If you're a racing game fan like me and want to step up your game, the Logitech G923 Racing Wheel is definitely worth considering. It's a solid upgrade that brings a touch of realism to your virtual races.

This is good for compatibility and plug&play hardware. The interface with almost all gaming rigs is a proven design that works. The G923 wheel is a very nice item, reasonably small and light, well made, lots of mounting options, and good reliability. The force feedback system really does work, especially if you take the time to tune it to specific tracks or cars. The pedal set is what brought my rating down to 4 stars. It's pretty ancient, the same pedals they've been using forever, and they're not remarkably reliable or durable. It's unfortunate that Logitech has chosen to sell their mediocre base level pedals with what is a pretty good wheel.\", '5': 'Nice wheel. Force Feedback is realistic!', '6': \"I've used this steering wheel for many different games such as F1 22, Forza, Asetto Corsa and lots more. Wheel works really great. It has amazing force feedback. Unfortunately the acceleration meter doesn't work on many games however that didn't bother me much. Overall great wheel.\", '7': \"I've had high end sim wheels, pedals... the whole setup. You can have just as much fun with this wheel and pedal set. I play F1 23 (PC) and the wheel is plenty responsive and smooth, as are the pedals. The force feedback isn't nearly as strong as a direct drive, but it doesn't detract from the experience and, in some cases, just makes it easier to drive.\\n\\nIf you're looking for the full sim feel, you'll have to take it up to the next level, be it Logitech or another brand. But if you're looking for a great wheel setup for enjoying driving games, actually having control, and having software support this is the best bang for your buck.\", '8': \"Wanted to get into sim racing. I have been an avid gamer since gaming came into fruition really. But I have recently found myself becoming bored of the new games and open world and shooters being pumped out yearly. I wanted to still enjoy my hobby of gaming, but how. Well driving of course. I highly enjoy anything with cars, so it was kind of a non brainer for me to get this after deciding. I paired this with the Logitech play seat trophy. Which is lovely combination function and form wise. The steering wheel is good first steering wheel, but we all know there are more expensive and better ones out there.

Good materials ..pedals are amazing\", '9': '', '10': '', '11': \" I recently picked up iracing, and using a controller I will tell you it's not fun. It limits your ability to feel how the car preforms on track and limits your ability to adjust controls. With this and the shifter that went away for me completely. The stand was part of this purchase and it serves its purpose. The wheel looks amazing and feels amazing to use but part that mounts to the stand or desk (depending on how you mount the wheel and shifter) is a bit big and bulky. But this helps it give you better grip on the wheel while also giving you feedback depending on how you set up the force feed back. With the stand built and the wheel, shifter, and the gas brake and clutch pedal board mounted properly the set up looks amazing! I do love the all black look of the 923 and I am very satisfied with my purchase. But if you're looking to get it for a lower price I recommend you try and get a black Friday deal or a used one that is certified renewed.\", '12': 'This was the safest way to test out wheels. Direct drive is obviously the way to go, but before I spent close to $500 just to get in the door I thought to give the next best thing a whirl. Spent a day trying to tweak settings including what was deemed the holy grail on Reddit. Car would to just start to sway with little to no input. Same race over-and-over 5 times and I was able to shave over a second off time. Promising, but again this was training myself to deal with what was ultimately a bad experience that was further from reality than the controller was.\\n\\nBiggest point of frustration was oversteer. Out of the throttle gentle steering input and I should be able to walk it back. Real life and the controller. The wheel would just continue into a slide and basically snap out of my hands until the car was so crossed up you were basically along for the ride until it stopped.\\n\\nOthers obviously get past this and figure things out. Unit feels solid and well built other than next to no rubber on the pedals to keep it from sliding around on the floor. Rig or wheel stand is a must from my short experience. In the end I play as a quick distraction from work and life. Supposed to be fun and cheaper than throwing a Spec Miata together for NASA events. The controller delivers, and doesn’t cause me frustration or the need to sink more money in something that will just take up more space than necessary. SIM racing is cool for some. I’d rather get in a real car. Leave the games as a cheap, fun distraction.\\n\\nHope this helps someone.'}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'rand_index', '_id': '0ufBc40B-Q_i0rt4NUzx', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Xbox Wireless Headset – Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows Devices', 'Product Price': '88', 'Product Rating': '4.5', 'Product Number of Rates': '11,249 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/51ODvrKqxTL._SX342_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Connectivity Technology: Wireless Wireless Technology: Bluetooth Sound Mode: Windows Sonic, Dolby Atmos, DTS Headphone: X Noise Canceling: Yes Headband Type: Adjustable ', 'Product Reviews': {'1': \"UPDATE: These wireless headphones are working much better now with a more recent update. I was experiencing frequent but very brief audio dropouts before the update, but it seems like the latest update has addressed this issue.

I liked that these connect directly to the console like a controller. Comparing these to the CloudX, the sound is so much better. There's serious bass to this thing, unlike the CloudX which sounds weak and flabby in the low end. It also feels sturdier. I love the convenience of connecting it without a dongle. As for fit, I liked the CloudX much more. This one is very tight on my head, but fortunately the ear cups are soft. It doesn't shift around on my head like the CloudX does, so I guess that's the trade-off. But there is one serious flaw that I can't seem to get around. The audio drops out intermittently. After around 15-20 minutes of use, the audio will start to drop out for a very brief moment, around a fraction of a second. This occurs about once a minute, and it grows to be very, very annoying and tiresome quickly. I use these for online gaming, and having my friend's voices or game audio drop out this frequently is driving me nuts. I'm sitting about 7 feet from the console with direct line of sight, nothing blocking the signal from my console to my headphones. The router isn't nearby, either, so I don't know what could be causing it. Turning it off and back on doesn't help either. The only solution is to turn the headset and console off and back on, which fixes the problem for about 15 minutes, then it's back to the frequent audio drops.\\n\\nI love everything else about this headset, but the annoying audio drops are really ruining an otherwise great product. If I find a solution, I will update this review.\", '2': \"So, I've been using the Xbox Wireless Headset, and I've got some thoughts to share.\\n\\nFirst off, the sound quality is quite impressive. The audio is clear and really adds depth to my gaming experience. The spatial audio feature is a neat touch, helping me better locate in-game sounds and giving me an edge in competitive play.\\n\\nComfort is a big deal for me during long gaming sessions, and this headset delivers. The ear cups are well-padded, and I can wear it for hours without discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit.\\n\\nWireless connectivity is seamless, and the battery life is reliable, meaning it doesn't conk out in the middle of an epic gaming session.\\n\\nThe microphone quality is good too, offering clear communication with my gaming buddies.\\n\\nAll in all, the Xbox Wireless Headset is a solid addition to my gaming setup. It combines excellent sound quality, comfort, and reliable wireless performance. I'd definitely recommend it to fellow gamers.\", '3': \"These are about as good as it gets for a sub $100 headset.\\n\\nSolid build, comfortable, good enough audio, and all kinds of slick features like adjusting volume with the outer earcups.\\n\\nOne of the cool features that some may not known about, is that you can have these connected to your Xbox and another Bluetooth device at the same time. So you can still get in-game audio while being able to listen to podcasts from your phone. This was honestly huge for me. On PC I love to listen to podcasts or random YouTube channels while I play. So at first I was kind of bummed that I wasn't really able to do that on Xbox. But these make it possible.\", '4': 'PROS:\\n\\n* Bass-heavy out of the box, but after a few equalizer tweaks sound is loud and clear\\n* Easily syncs with your Xbox, Windows, PC, and even your phone!\\n* Can power your Xbox on and off from the headset\\n* Volume, chat, and game audio are easily controlled by turning the left and right ear pieces, making them really easy and fast tk adjust during gameplay\\n* Comfortable and fits snugly\\n* GAME CHANGER: allows simultaneous syncing with your phone and Xbox! Can automatically reduce game and chat audio for an incoming call\\n* USB-C charging\\n*\\n\\nCONS:\\n* Sound is garbage out of the box.

Sound and features far better than Turtle Beach products in the same price range. Really hope they last…', '5': \"Admittedly, I went with another brand first due to its price point and review ratings. That other brand connected just fine with my Xbox One X but no audio came out of the headset. I tried changing settings on the TV and console, did research online, but still unsuccessful. So, I returned it. I bought the actual Xbox brand headset at just around $10 more. I charged it overnight and then connected it the next day. It too a little longer than expected for the headset to pair with the console but it eventually did. As soon as it was connected, I could hear the headset produce audio as it is intended to do. I've been using it for several days now and have been extremely happy with its fit an function. If you are an audiophile that holds electronics at a high standard, this may not meet your expectations. However for me and most other gamers, the sound quality is very good and the bass is more than sufficient. I like that you can control the volume by turning the side of the headset. You can also control the chat/game fader the same way. Why is this a big deal? Because you don't have to fumble with trying to locate the volume buttons due to the dials being the entire side of the headset. It's hard to mess up.\\n\\nI hope this review helps other gamers out there looking for an affordable and more than adequate headset that can be connected to not only your Xbox, but your phone and other devices.\", '6': \"I own Razer..B&O(highly Recommend if you got the money).

Miles above the HyperX headset I had before this.', '8': \"I have been using this headset for the last couple of months, everything came fine when I bought it, and so far I really like the experience with it, the battery holds up some hours, nothing mind-blowing but it's also really easy to charge with the front USB port of the Xbox (you can change this with the Xbox turn off)\\n\\nThe sound is great, it has a heavy base and you can configure everything as you would like on the headset configuration page on your Xbox (These settings are stored in the headset itself, so using it on a PC or Phone will have the changes)\\n\\nI mostly use this for when I'm going to play with friends, the mic sounds perfect and you don't need to move the thing to be able to catch your voice, I also noticed it's very directional, so if I'm seen a video on my phone, with a reasonable distance from the mic it doesn't catch any sound away from my voice, which is really cool.\\n\\nThe only issue I have with this headset is that it's kind of uncomfortable with prolonged gaming sessions if you use glasses, I think that it's more like an issue with my glasses than the proper headset, my glasses have like a curve, they are not 100% straight with the sides of my head and I think that adds pressure, so yeah, after using this for a while I start to feel some discomfort/pain on the sides of the head. I will say it happens after 2-3 hours so nothing that bad, but it happens.\\n\\nI'm still happy with the product, I easily recommend this as a good companion for your Xbox.\", '9': \"So, I'm not an avid gamer by any means. I recently got an Xbox Series S and it came with the wired headset, but I kept getting the wire all wrapped around my hand or I would pull it out while trying to put my controller down and go into the other room. It got very annoying very fast. I did research on headsets for a couple weeks. I didn't want to spend unnecessary money on an expensive pair that I wasn't actually happy with or had features I really didn't need.\\n\\nThe main features I was looking for in a headset were: wireless, simultaneous Bluetooth and mic monitoring. Nothing fancy at all. I have to say it was incredibly hard to find more than a few headsets that had simultaneous Bluetooth connection so that I could listen to music or take phone calls while I was also gaming and hearing the audio from that. When I saw these did it, I was really excited and thought it was a better option than shelling out more money for some higher tier headsets like the SS Arctis 9X or TBs. I read too many mixed reviews about those, where the negatives were just too worrisome for me to really consider getting them. I did see mixed reviews for these, but I took the risk since they are not as expensive and I figured I'll just try to be extra gentle when handling them.\\n\\nSo far, these are definitely what I needed and wanted! The simultaneous Bluetooth is a huge win for me. A friend of mine doesn't have a headset, so we just talk on a phone call while we game, but I'm absolutely still able to hear the audio from whatever game I'm playing. There's also an in-game chat mixer built in, just rotate the outer part of the left ear cup to adjust as needed. Volume adjusting is the right side ear cup.\\n\\nThe ear cups feel very comfortable. It's some type of memory foam. I haven't noticed any sort of discomfort unless I play for 6+ hours straight and that happens rarely and I really only think that's due to the fact that I wear glasses. The head band also is comfortable for the most part. I would say that I do start to notice a bit of discomfort after a few hours. I don't really mind this, as I usually just slightly adjust it forward or back or my head once in a while. Not a big deal for me, though.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like is the placement of the microphone mute button... all the way on the back of left ear cup on the mic piece. It's not on the mic itself, but the arm of it, which also could be a bit longer in my opinion. Sometimes I worry I'm not close enough to it for it to clearly pick up my voice, but luckily the mic monitoring does help me to know how loud or quiet I am and if the other people can hear me.\\n\\nAltogether I'm very happy with these and I'll try to give an update to my review after 6+ months of use.\", '10': \"Easy to pair but wish the instructions it comes with had at least a sentence in each one than just pictures because would love to know how long the battery lasts bur i will keep it updated and see how long it actually lasts me fully charged( took me about 14 hrs till it died and i had to charge it again) and how long it takes to charge the headset( took about 1hr and a half or so) but other than that it's easy to pair this headset because it pairs exactly like controller and after it pairs then you can use it, to turn it off and on all you have to do is press the button once to turn off and hold the button for a couple of seconds to turn it on and Xbox sends a notification when you turn it on.. also when pressing the mute button the light on the mic turns off and when mute is off the light turns on but you can also get use to the mute noise when on or off and everything is all good so far but will keep this updated within the next few months and my finally thoughts on this headset.\"}, 'Related Products': []}}, {'_index': 'rand_index', '_id': '0-fBc40B-Q_i0rt4NkwU', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals, Real Force Feedback, Stainless Steel Paddle Shifters, Leather Steering Wheel Cover for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Mac - Black', 'Product Price': None, 'Product Rating': '4.6', 'Product Number of Rates': '19,438 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/611TWGHXWyL._AC_SY355_.jpg', 'Product Description': 'Brand Logitech G Model Name Logitech G920 Compatible Devices Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC, Windows, Mac, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Playstation 5 Controller Type Paddle, Pedals, Steering Wheel Connectivity Technology USB  Immersive Gaming Experience: Perfect for Xbox and PC gaming titles, the Driving Force simulates the feeling of driving a real car with precision steering and pressure-sensitive pedals Premium Control: The Driving Force feedback racing wheel provides a detailed simulation of driving a real car, with helical gearing delivering smooth, quiet steering and a hand-stitched leather cover Customizable Pedals: These pressure-sensitive nonlinear brake pedals provide a responsive, accurate braking feel on a sturdy base - with adjustable pedal faces for finer control 900-Degree Rotation: Lock-to-lock rotation of the Driving Force means you can turn the wheel around two and a half times, hand over hand on wide turns - just like a real F1 race car Up Your Game: Take your racing simulation to the next level with Driving Force accessories like the Driving Force Shifter or desk and rig mounts The plastic parts in G920 include 52% certified post consumer recycled plastic*; certified carbon neutral Wheel: Length: 10.24 in (260 mm) Height: 10.63 in (270 mm) Width: 10.94 in (278 mm) Weight without cables: 4.96 lb (2.25 Kg) Pedals: Length: 16.87 in (428.5 mm) Height: 6.57 in (167 mm) Width: 12.24 in (311 mm) Weight without cables: 6.83 (3.1 Kg) ', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'Alright, I\\'ll preface this by saying I\\'m not a racing sim person. Never have been. I\\'d gotten an earlier version of Forza for the Xbox 360 out of curiosity, and my son enjoyed it a bit, but neither of us really got into it, being into first person shooters instead on the consoles...\\n\\nBut in April I grabbed an Oculus Rift, and of course one of the things I ultimately had to try was a racing game, and it really turned it into a different experience. Enough that I decided I needed to try a wheel and pedals to control it, not just the Xbox controller. So I did some digging, and this was the one that seemed to hit the right price point and was supported in the Project Cars game I have on the Oculus system.\\n\\nSetting up couldn\\'t be much easier - I was clamping it to my PC stand (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BBKNI6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and that actually worked quite well, but I did end up just ordering an actual racing wheel stand this evening to improve the experience. The only thing I would\\'ve wanted them to change is to have some kind of plate or bar on the bottom to help hold all the cables in place as you\\'re getting things set up. There are small channels underneath this, where they run, so they\\'re recessed and this sits flat on the surface you\\'re clamping it to. But I had issues with a short cable getting pulled out the first time I was setting things up. Having something that slid over that to help keep them in place would\\'ve been nice. But it\\'s a minor annoyance, wasn\\'t even worth dropping a star.\\n\\nSo once you get things plugged into this, you can connect it to power, but don\\'t plug into the PC until you\\'ve installed the software, which will then prompt you to connect the USB cable. I did this on Windows 10, and had no issues.\\n\\nThere was a firmware update right away, so I ran that as well. Then it was time to play.\\n\\nProject Cars in the Oculus had support for this, so that\\'s what I tried first, and then realized that this is apparently a game that reverses the pedals by default, so I had to go into the options and remap all three pedals to get it to work. But once I did that, I was quite blown away by the experience.\\n\\nHaving never used a racing wheel before, I didn\\'t expect the force holding the wheel in place. I expected force feedback as things happened, but I didn\\'t realize how firmly this wheel was going to hold the center position. But it\\'s awesome since it really helps keep you stable.\\n\\nMost of the video reviews and such talked about how it takes time to convert from a controller to a wheel, and that you can expect to \"relearn\" since it\\'s a whole different experience. I didn\\'t have that issue, since my racing sim gaming was so minimal. I took to it quite quickly, and inside of about three or four races, I had a good feel for it, and my performance soared compared to the hand held controller.\\n\\nMany people complain about the bright light on the wheel above the Xbox button. For me, not an issue since I have a headset on for the VR system, but I can see how that would be annoying if you\\'re using monitors. Nothing a bit of tape wouldn\\'t solve, but I think the least they could have done is had an option in the software settings to turn the light off altogether.\\n\\nButton placement is alright, I wish they had been a little closer to the wheel\\'s edges to make it easier to hit, but they\\'re not hard to get at as they are, just not quite as ergonomic as I would\\'ve hoped.\\n\\nUnit is pretty quiet as well.\\n\\nI see a lot of people complain about the brake pedal being stiff, and it certainly is, compared to the others, but for me it isn\\'t an issue. I may not know enough about these though to have the \"right feel\" for how it SHOULD be, and that may be why it doesn\\'t bother me. But as a total racing sim tyro, it\\'s not causing me any issues at all.\\n\\nFor me, this really became a \"Wow, I\\'m sure glad I got this!\" kind of an item the first day I had it. With the VR headset, this really completes the immersion. And when it\\'s on this desk I\\'m using right now, and I\"m on the bench in front of the setup, my hands are EXACTLY where they show up in the Oculus, so the illusion is complete for me.\\n\\nFeels great, love the resistance in turns since that really helps me keep on track and not spin out as much, and while the price seems steep to me, I didn\\'t have many options considering I\\'m on a Windows 10 PC and may use it on the Xbox One as well at some point. But while the price was steep, I\\'m looking at it as one of those, \"You get what you pay for\" things. It completes the illusion of actually racing, and that made the price point less of an issue for me.', '2': \"Not even pressing on the pedals and it shows full input on all 3 pedals. Doesn't change if I use them.\\n\\nPlaying any racing game the accelerator and clutch pedal are combined. Sometimes the accelerator will go up to 30-50% and I have to press the clutch to reach 100% as if they were combined eventho that box remains unchecked. I let it go a few months hoping it was driver related, constantly Uninstalling and reinstalling different drivers but nothing has changes.\\n\\nWorse experience I've had in a LONG time. Waste of money. I hope I can get warranties or my money back. So frustrating, so disappointing.\\n\\n***Update***\\nAfter some rough customer service via web chat and trying to warranty the product and waited for the warranty email I had never received, I was sure it was a hardware defect and not a software defect.\\n\\nI found a pinch in the main wire whip right by the pedal assembly. After rewiring the 5 wires with solder+water proof heatshrink, the pedals worked phenomenally!!!\\n\\nI do like logitec but it seems like their QC has gone south quite a bit. I had a $100 keyboard that lasted just passed the warranty as well as a g502 hero Special Edition mouse. I went back to my worn OG-502 and no other mouse compares...\\n\\nSo about the setup... Finally aving some seat time on the PC with the G920 wheel, pedals, and 6 speed shifter with the addition of a USB handbrake..... the experience is u parallel.. it work from Forza to spin tires, it work with every driving game. If you like racing games or sims and don't want to drop over 1k for an indoor pass time or hobby but get great force feedback and a unique feel to every pedal. Then definitely gamble and get one of these logitecs. If you have a few extra bills to blow, get something better and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n***Update, a month or so after this review I found a fault in the wiring, I cut out the bad section and spliced the wires back together, works great, great product. I bought my friend one as a gift after I fixed my own.***\\n\\nI would buy again. But I already did :)\", '3': \"Seems like a great starter wheel. I do feel like there could be something better for securing the wheel to the desk, but with some effort, it's fine. Also, the brake is very hard to apply fully because of stiffness, but not a deal breaker.\\n\\nThe force feedback is great, and the feel of the wheel is great. I like the leather wrap. Very functional. I've used it often since purchase and it has held up very well.\", '4': \"Wish I had done my research before purchasing. A few weeks after I bought this my brother bought the Thrustmaster TMX PRO which sells for basically the same price as this or less. After using his wheel I would definitely have bought that.\\n\\nBoth wheels do not come with a shifter and both do have the clutch pedal and conical brake mod for more realistic braking feel. Yet on the TMX PRO the mod is easily installed or removed depending on your preference. On the Logitech it is permanently installed and requires invasive action to remove which also voids the warranty. I like it though, it was a little too stiff at first but after about 30 hours of racing it has broken in and feels great.\\n\\nBoth wheels offer an optional shifter, and the Logitech one offers 4 things over the Thrustmaster's, push down reverse, alot quieter, very short throw, and a much lower price. The Thrustmaster one is over twice the price, but it feels better, is made mostly of metal and is harder to accidentally put in to the wrong gear. The Thrustmaster also has a separate gate plate that is included with it to make it a sequential shifter. This is excellent for rally driving where the paddle shifters can be difficult to use. It is however very squishy in sequential mode not having that nice positive click that a sequential shifter should have. Because of that I would not purchase it if you're mainly looking for a sequential shifter due to its poor feedback. Their are better dedicated options out there.\\n\\nThe pedals on the Logitech are 8 bit giving a total of 256 unique positions. This sounds like a lot, but when running F1 cars where braking needs to be incredibly precise the Thrustmaster 12 bit pedals with 4,096 unique positions are noticeably better. The Logitech pedals do grip the carpet better though and look nicer.\\n\\nThe wheel, the G920 is prettier by far. The all brushed metal construction with leather wrap looks good and feels good in the hand. The Thrustmaster is mostly plastic with some rubber grips at the 10 and 2 'o clock positions. It looks cheap and initially feels cheap too. It is however about a 1/4 inch larger than the Logitech and I like the slight increase in size.\\n\\nYet this is where the Thrustmaster runs away with the show for me. When actually driving with it the force feedback is noticeably better, its more precise and less notchy. I can't say it is in a whole other league over the Logitech, but it is better. The cheapness of the plastic wheel is all but forgotten from the excellent precision feel you get from the force feedback.\\n\\nThat being said the Logitech is not without its upsides like better looks and overall build quality. The wheel base does have bolt holes for hard mounting. Which is real nice when using it with a stand. The TMX PRO on the other hand has no mounting holes and its desk clamp sticks down so much it will block your keyboard tray. The Logitech uses dual soft mounts that don't stick down nearly as much allowing access to your keyboard. Both wheel's pedal boxes and optional shifters do have bolt holes for hard mounting.\\n\\nFrom what I've read around the net, the TMX pro does have a higher failer rate. So if you are looking for something to last a long time the Logitech would most likely be your better bet. Its dual motor gear force feedback system is antiquated and has been around since the G27 wheel which is why it doesn't feel quite as nice as it could. Yet it is a proven system with many G27 wheels still in use today. I'm just speculating, but I think this may be why Logitech has chosen not to update it, just because it has proven to be so reliable.\", '5': 'This works perfectly with Forza on my Xbox. I bought this for a sim racing experience and I’m quite impressed for the price point. I wanted something to practice track driving in the winter and this works well with my setup. A lot of reviews mention the brake being too stiff. I think it feels real if you are used to an actual track car. It does not feel like a mushy video game brake or even a passenger car with power brakes. I have an Ariel Atom it it actually feels quite similar. If you want to brake hard you have to stand on it and that’s how it should be. Highly impressed with the steering wheel and the brake. Accelerator is good. Clutch could use a tiny bit more tension but it’s good enough. Zero complaints. Great product, especially for the money.', '6': 'Feels great but 3 annoyances... the buttons are far from the wheel and no buttons on the wheel... my ferrari wheel had 4 on the wheel, these you have to partially come off the wheel and hunt for, no good during f1 games but ok for street car games i suppose.\\n\\nSecond annoyance is that the spacing between the pedals is too narrow, might be ok for kid feet but could do with more spacing for adults, especially when wearing shoes since this is bare metal and no rubber/platic so rather slippery.\\n\\n3rd annoyance is the turning range, which i guess for some people would be a bonus? but on a computer desk you cant really turn more than 90 degrees left or right of center easily... looks like this designed to be on a specialized open gaming chair rig... again, an annoyance as some games dont allow you to edit the wheel turn distance so youll have to really tinker with sensitivity curves to get it useable.\\n\\nother than that, again, annoyances not major as i still gave it 5 stars, its a great wheel and pedal set, far better than my older ferrari 3 in 1 setup!', '7': 'This wheel is great! Its super easy to set up and clamps right to your desk. Its force feedback is customizable with the installation of Logitech G Hub. You can customize it per game or just an overall tweak. Makes driving games super fun.', '8': 'I never liked trying to play a racing game with the standard Xbox controller, but I put up with it for years, not wanting to spend the money on a wheel. Well, I finally took the plunge and after first buying the wrong one (the PS version) I got this one when it was on sale around Christmas.\\n\\nAt first, I made a crude stand for it using two plastic sawhorses and 3/4\" plywood. It worked ok, but wasn\\'t ideal. Plus, we were finishing the room it was in and that setup wasn\\'t going to fly. So, I bought an adjustable wheel stand. The G920 mounted to it pretty easily and it\\'s stable enough to handle the most aggressive driving.\\n\\nAs for the G920 itself, it\\'s been great. I did learn quickly that you have to adjust it within the games or it can be more difficult to handle than the controller. I had constant oversteer in corners of Forza Horizon games until I looked up some tips on what input variables to adjust. Now, it works great. I\\'ve ordered the shifter. I know that manual shifting is dying out in real vehicles, but I still enjoy it and look forward to that addition in the near future. My only complaint is that the USB cable isn\\'t long enough. In my setup, it\\'s hanging in the air when the wheel stand is in its position and its plugged into the Xbox. I guess I can get an extender, but haven\\'t done so yet.\\n\\nThe wheel and pedals are pretty well made and feel fairly solid. The paddle shifters work well and the force feedback is pretty strong. It has taken some adjustment on my part as when I used the standard controller, I accepted that it was a video game and wouldn\\'t feel like driving a real car or truck. With the wheel, I kind of expected it to feel EXACTLY like a real car, but there is a bit of numbness--even though the wheel tries to transmit some road feel.\\n\\nAs this is the only wheel/pedal setup I\\'ve ever used, I can\\'t compare it to others, but I\\'ve been extremely happy with it so far and the addition of the shifter is sure to make it even more enjoyable.', '9': \"This is Logitechs G29 (PS) for Xbox. The force feedback is nice, and the wheel itself has a fairly sturdy feel. I haven't owned a wheel since the one that came out with a Forza game back on Xbox 360.\\n\\nBut I can't NOT be irritated by the fact that the wheel has two buttons that DO NOT FUNCTION.\\n\\nYou'll see, in the images, LSB and RSB buttons. In a lot of driving games this is extremely important. I primarily play Snow Runner, so swapping between cameras is mandatory in certain situations - Plan on having to use your controller.\\n\\nThere is NO support for these buttons and as far as I know, no reason to fix it. At the time I purchased the G920, it likely WAS the best deal on the market in this price range. However, since its release, several other manufacturers have joined the space with options in the same price range.\\n\\nFunctionally, it's still a good starter wheel and I've enjoyed it, but it REALLY irritates me that I have to use my controller to use my wheel. If you send ANY input through the controller it immediately stops listening to your wheel. Want to adjust yoru camera so you can fit around that corner? Better come to a complete stop first or your last throttle input may just continue rolling forward, while your wheel does nothing because you're in the middle of adjusting your camera to see around the bend.\\n\\nI don't write a lot of reviews, and this may seem silly, but it isn't to me.\\n\\nGood entry wheel, unless you're a usability nerd like me and get angry about dumb stuff like having NON FUNCTIONAL buttons on the wheel. It kind of digs at me just thinking about it. Why not just remove the buttons?\\n\\nI don't know if they work on the PS G29 or not. Nor do I care at this point - I've simply resigned to the fact that this will always irritate me so it's best to return it and pick something that doesn't have non-functional 'features'.\", '10': 'Hey there, speed demons and laughter aficionados!

It averages the precision scores across all queries (or items, in your case).

An RMSE of 2.22 suggests that, on average, the system's predictions are about 2.22 units away from the actual values.
